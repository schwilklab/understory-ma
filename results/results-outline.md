Methods
=======
We conducted a meta-analysis using means and standard errors to calculate effect sizes.

For each response variable, we examine comparisons across three treatment pairs: burn versus control, thin vs control and thin vs burn. We calculated  standardized mean differences (Hedgesâ€™ adjusted g, Hedges and Olkin 1985) for each pair and tested if this differed from zero using a random effects model fit with restricted maximum likelihood (Borenstein et al. 2009, Viechtbauer, 2010, other citations?). We conducted all analyses in R (R Core Team 2013) using the metafor package (Viechtbauer 2010).

Results
=======

Summary of Results
------------------
Most understory variables did not vary among treatments. Of the differences that were significant, most tended to take place with regards to native and exotic plants.

###Summary of Species Richness Results:

The richness of exotic plants was significantly higher in thin treatments than in control and burn treatments.

###Summary of Percent Cover Results:

The cover of native plants was significantly higher in thin treatments than in control and burn treatments. The cover of exotic plants was  significantly higher in thin treatments than in control treatments. In addition, the cover of shrubs was significantly lower in burn treatments than in control treatments.

- Richness or Cover: x vs y (left)
	- Indicates that there was lower richness or cover in x treatment than in y treatment.

- Total richness: thin vs control (right)

Talk about how native and total are very similar

Talk about how native was used for total in many cases, when total was not reported
