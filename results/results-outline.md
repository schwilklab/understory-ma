Methods:
We conducted a formal meta-analysis using means and standard errors to calculate effect sizes.
We looked at continuous traits, but discrete factors. We looked at the effect of discrete factors for control vs treatments.
We utilized pairwise comparisons of a continuous response variable using standardized mean difference in a nested model.
Significance was determined by whether the 95% confidence intervals for the standardized mean difference crossed zero.

Summary of Results:
There were very few differences. Of the differences that were significant, most tended to be between thin and control groups for native species, thin and control groups for exotic species,
burn and control groups for exotic species. Specifically, the richness of all native plants was significantly higher in thin treatments than richness of all native plants in control treatments.
The richness of all exotic plants was significantly higher in thin treatments than richness of all exotic plants in control treatments.
However, the richness of all exotic plants was significantly lower in burn treatments than richness of all exotic plants in control treatments.
The percent cover of all native plants was significantly higher in thin treatments than richness of all native plants in control treatments.
In addition, the percent cover of all native plants was significantly higher in thin treatments than richness of all native plants in burn treatments.
The percent cover of all exotic plants was significantly higher in thin treatments than percent cover of all exotic plants in control treatments.
However, the percent cover of all exotic plants was significantly lower  in burn treatments than percent cover of all exotic plants in control treatments.
With the addition of additional papers to the study, it may be possible to see additional trends.
