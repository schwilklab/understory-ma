Methods:
We conducted a formal meta-analysis using means and standard errors to calculate effect sizes.
We looked at continuous traits, but discrete factors. We looked at the effect of discrete factors for control vs treatments.
We utilized pairwise comparisons of a continuous response variable using standardized mean difference in a nested model.
Significance was determined by whether the 95% confidence intervals for the standardized mean difference crossed zero.

Summary of Results:
Most understory variables did not vary among treatments. Of the differences that were significant, most tended to be between thin and control groups for native species, thin and control groups for exotic species, and burn and control groups for exotic species.

Summary of Species Richness Results:
The richness of native and exotic plants was significantly higher in thin treatments than in control treatments. However, the richness of exotic plants was significantly lower in burn treatments than in control treatments.

Summary of Percent Cover Results:
The cover of native and exotic plants was significantly higher in thin treatments than in control treatments. The cover of native plants was also significanly higher in thin treatments than in burn treatments. However, the cover of exotic plants was significantly lower in burn treatments than in control treatments.
