  Abstract                 = {A cladistic analysis based on 63 morphological characters was carried out on the tribe Colletieae including two presumed closely related genera. Ceanothus and Noltea as outgroups. In addition to a parsimony analysis of the equally weighted characters, analyses investigating the: effects of character weighting, removal of a presumed hybrid species as well as the impact of uncertainly scored characters were undertaken. In ail analyses Noltea was placed as sister group to a well supported monophyletic Colletieae. Nineteen different ingroup topologies were found, with the additional analyses mainly supporting two of them. Within the Colletieae a basal dichotomy divides Trevoa and Retanilla from the remainder of the tribe. While the Trevoa-Retanilla clade is fully resolved, the second lacks detailed resolution. Within this clade the Colletia species form a weil supported monophyletic group, while monophyly of the disjunct genus Discaria could not be confirmed. (C) 1999 The Linnean Society of London.},

  Abstract                 = {As monitoring plans for the restoration of Pinus ponderosa forests in the southwestern United States evolve toward examining multifactor ecosystem responses to ecological restoration, designing efficient sampling procedures for understory vegetation will become increasingly important. The objective of this study was to compare understory composition and diversity among thin/burn and control treatments in a P. ponderosa restoration, while simultaneously examining the effects of sampling design and multivariate analyses on which conclusions were based. Using multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP), we tested the null hypothesis of no difference in understory species composition among treatments using different data matrices (e.g., frequency and cover) for two different sampling methods. Treatment differences were subtle and were detected by an intensive 50, 1-m(2) subplot sampling method for all data matrices but were not detected by a less intensive point-intercept sampling method for any matrix. Sampling methods examined in this study controlled results of multivariate analyses more than the data matrices used to summarize data generated by a sampling method. We partitioned data into plant life form and native/exotic species categories for MRPP, and this partitioning isolated plant groups most responsible for treatment differences. We also examined the effects of number of 1-m(2) subplots sampled on mean-species-richness/m(2) estimates and found that estimates based on 10 subplots and based on 50 subplots were highly correlated (r = 0.99). Species-area curves indicated that the 50, 1-m(2) subplot sampling method detected the common species of sites but failed to detect the majority of rare species. Additional sampling-design studies are needed to develop single sampling designs that produce multifactor data on plant composition, diversity, and spatial patterns amenable to multivariate analyses as part of monitoring plans of vegetation responses to ecological restoration.},

An analysis of a simple model of exploitative competition reveals that higher {DIM} may increase the niche separation required for competing species to coexist. This is the opposite of the relationship proposed by Pianka. Confusion regarding this issue may have arisen from a failure to define the intensity of competition. Several possible meanings of this term are presented and discussed in relation to the evolution of interference competition. The nature of correlations between intrinsic rate of increase and competitive ability is especially important in determining whether {DIM} will ever make coexistence of competitors more likely.},

  Abstract                 = {The widespread correspondence between phenotypic variation and environmental conditions, the "fit" of organisms to their environment, reflects the adaptive value of plant functional traits. Several processes contribute to these patterns: plasticity, ecological sorting, and adaptive evolution. This article addresses the importance of ecological sorting processes (community assembly, migration, habitat tracking, etc.) as primary causes of functional trait distributions at the local and landscape level. In relatively saturated communities, plants will establish and regenerate in environments to which they are well adapted, so their distributions, and the distributions of associated functional traits, will reflect the distribution of optimal or near-optimal environmental conditions in space and time. The predicted evolutionary corollary of this process is that traits related to habitat occupancy, e. g., environmental tolerances, will be under stabilizing selection. This process contributes to the widely observed pattern of phylogenetic niche conservatism, i. e., ecological and phenotypic similarities of closely related species. Evidence for niche conservatism in plants is reviewed. Based on Jackson and Overpeck's concept of the realized environment, I propose three scenarios in which a species' distributional responses to environmental conditions will lead to a "mismatch" between its environmental tolerances and the environments it occupies, thus creating opportunities for adaptive evolution: (1) the colonization of "environmental islands" (habitats that are discontinuous in niche space) that require large adaptive shifts in tolerance of one or more environmental factors; (2) the persistence of "trailing-edge" populations in species tracking changing climate, if barriers to dispersal of competitors prevent competitive exclusion in the deteriorating conditions; and (3) responses to changes in the realized environment in multidimensional niche space, in which species are predicted to track environmental factors for which they exhibit narrow tolerances and exhibit adaptive evolutionary response along axes where they exhibit greater niche breadth. These three scenarios provide a conceptual framework that emphasizes the role of ecological sorting processes and stabilizing selection as the context for understanding opportunities for adaptive evolution in heterogeneous and changing environments.},

  Abstract                 = {Independent contrasts are widely used to incorporate phylogenetic information into studies of continuous traits, particularly analyses of evolutionary trait correlations, but the effects of taxon sampling on these analyses have received little attention. In this paper, simulations were used to investigate the effects of taxon sampling patterns and alternative branch length assignments on the statistical performance of correlation coefficients and sign tests; ''full-tree'' analyses based on contrasts at all nodes and ''paired-comparisons'' based only on contrasts of terminal taxon pairs were also compared. The simulations showed that random samples, with respect to the traits under consideration, provide statistically robust estimates of trait correlations. However, exact significance tests are highly dependent on appropriate branch length information; equal branch lengths maintain lower Type I error than alternative topological approaches, and adjusted critical values of the independent contrast correlation coefficient are provided for use with equal branch lengths. Nonrandom samples, with respect to univariate or bivariate trait distributions, introduce discrepancies between interspecific and phylogenetically structured analyses and bias estimates of underlying evolutionary correlations. Examples of nonrandom sampling processes may include community assembly processes, convergent evolution under local adaptive pressures, selection of a nonrandom sample of species from a habitat or life-history group, or investigator bias. Correlation analyses based on species pairs comparisons, while ignoring deeper relationships, entail significant loss of statistical power and as a result provide a conservative test of trait associations. Paired comparisons in which species differ by a large amount in one trait, a method introduced in comparative plant ecology, have appropriate Type I error rates and high statistical power, but do not correctly estimate the magnitude of trait correlations. Sign tests, based on full-tree or paired-comparison approaches, are highly reliable across a wide range of sampling scenarios, in terms of Type I error rates, but have very low power. These results provide guidance for selecting species and applying comparative methods to optimize the performance of statistical tests of trait associations.},

We present a trait-based approach that provides an additive decomposition of species' trait values into alpha and beta components: beta values refer to a species' position along a gradient defined by community-level mean trait values; alpha values are the difference between a species' trait values and the mean of co-occurring taxa. In woody plant communities of coastal California, beta trait values for specific leaf area, leaf size, wood density and maximum height all covary strongly, reflecting species distributions across a gradient of soil moisture availability. Alpha values, on the other hand, are generally not significantly correlated, suggesting several independent axes of differentiation within communities. This trait-based framework provides a novel approach to integrate functional ecology and gradient analysis with community ecology and coexistence theory.},

  Abstract                 = {Prior studies of a broad array of seed plants have reported strong correlations among leaf life span, specific leaf area, nitrogen concentration, and carbon assimilation rates, which have been interpreted as evidence of coordinated leaf physiological strategies. However, it is not known whether these relationships reflect patterns of evolutionary convergence, or whether they are due to contrasting characteristics of major seed plant lineages. We reevaluated a published data set for these seven traits measured in over 100 species, using phylogenetic independent contrasts calculated over a range of alternative seed plant phylogenies derived from recent molecular systematic analyses. In general, pairwise correlations among these seven traits were similar with and without consideration of phylogeny, and results were robust over a range of alternative phylogenies. We also evaluated relationships between these seven traits and lamina area, another important aspect of leaf function, and found moderate correlations with specific leaf area (0.64), mass-based photosynthesis (0.54), area-based nitrogen (-0.56), and leaf life span (-0.42). However, several of these correlations were markedly reduced using independent contrasts; for example, the correlation between leaf life span and lamina area was reduced to close to zero. This change reflects the large differences in both these traits between conifers and angiosperms and the absence of a relationship between the traits within these groups. This analysis illustrates that most interspecific relationships among leaf functional traits, considered across a broad range of seed plant taxa, reflect significant patterns of correlated evolutionary change, lending further support to the adaptive interpretation of these relationships.},

  Abstract                 = {Large-scale biogeographical shifts in vegetation are predicted in response to the altered precipitation and temperature regimes associated with global climate change. Vegetation shifts have profound ecological impacts and are an important climate-ecosystem feedback through their alteration of carbon, water, and energy exchanges of the land surface. Of particular concern is the potential for warmer temperatures to compound the effects of increasingly severe droughts by triggering widespread vegetation shifts via woody plant mortality. The sensitivity of tree mortality to temperature is dependent on which of 2 non-mutually-exclusive mechanisms predominates—temperature-sensitive carbon starvation in response to a period of protracted water stress or temperature-insensitive sudden hydraulic failure under extreme water stress (cavitation). Here we show that experimentally induced warmer temperatures (≈4 °C) shortened the time to drought-induced mortality in Pinus edulis (piñon shortened pine) trees by nearly a third, with temperature-dependent differences in cumulative respiration costs implicating carbon starvation as the primary mechanism of mortality. Extrapolating this temperature effect to the historic frequency of water deficit in the southwestern United States predicts a 5-fold increase in the frequency of regional-scale tree die-off events for this species due to temperature alone. Projected increases in drought frequency due to changes in precipitation and increases in stress from biotic agents (e.g., bark beetles) would further exacerbate mortality. Our results demonstrate the mechanism by which warmer temperatures have exacerbated recent regional die-off events and background mortality rates. Because of pervasive projected increases in temperature, our results portend widespread increases in the extent and frequency of vegetation die-off.},

Here, we use classical coexistence theory to reframe the debate in terms of stabilizing mechanisms (niches) and fitness equivalence (neutrality). The neutral model is a special case where stabilizing mechanisms are absent and species have equivalent fitness. Instead of asking whether niches or neutral processes structure communities, we advocate determining the degree to which observed diversity reflects strong stabilizing mechanisms overcoming large fitness differences or weak stabilization operating on species of similar fitness. To answer this question, we propose combining data on per capita growth rates with models to: (i) quantify the strength of stabilizing processes; (ii) quantify fitness inequality and compare it with stabilization; and (iii) manipulate frequency dependence in growth to test the consequences of stabilization and fitness equivalence for coexistence.},

The effectiveness of fuelbreaks remains a subject of debate because of differing fuelbreak objectives, prescriptions for creation and maintenance, and their placement in landscapes with differing fire regimes. A well-designed fuelbreak will alter the behavior of wildland fire entering the fuel-altered zone. Both surface and crown fire behavior may be reduced, Shaded fuelbreaks must be created in the context of the landscape within which they are placed. No absolute standards for fuelbreak width or fuel reduction are possible, although recent proposals for forested fuelbreaks suggest 400 m wide bands where surface fuels are reduced and crown fuels are thinned, Landscape-level treatments such as prescribed fire can use shaded fuelbreaks as anchor points, and extend the zone of altered fire behavior to larger proportions of the landscape. Coupling fuelbreaks with area-wide fuel treatments can reduce the size, intensity, and effects of wildland fires. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Successful fire exclusion in the 20th century has created severe fire problems across the West. Not every forest is at risk of uncharacteristically severe wildfire, but drier forests are in need of active management to mitigate fire hazard. We summarize a set of simple principles important to address in fuel reduction treatments: reduction of surface fuels, increasing the height to live crown, decreasing crown density, and retaining large trees of fire-resistant species. Thinning and prescribed fire can be useful tools to achieve these objectives. Low thinning will be more effective than crown or selection thinning, and management of surface fuels will increase the likelihood that the stand will survive a wildfire. Five empirical examples of such treatment are discussed: Hayfork fires, California, 1987; Tyee fire, Washington, 1994; Megram fire, California, 1999; Hayman fire, Colorado, 2002; and the Cone fire, California, 2002. Applying treatments at an appropriate landscape scale will be critical to the success of fuel reduction treatments in reducing wildfire losses in Western forests. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

It is found that when seed production varies stochastically in time, species too similar with respect to these parameters can not outcompete each other, a special case of which is that ecologically identical species coexist stably. This contrasts with classical niche theory which predicts that there is a limit to similarity of species competing for the same resources.},

  Abstract                 = {We examined properties of adaptive walks by the fittest on ''rough Mt.

A single adaptive walk is carried out by repetition of the evolution cycle composed of (1) mutagenesis process that produces random d-fold point mutants of population size N and (2) selection process that picks out the fittest mutant among them. To comprehend trajectories of the walkers, the fitness landscape is mapped into a (x, y, z)-space, where x, y and z represent, respectively, normalized Hamming distance from the peak on the additive fitness landscape, scaled additive fitness and scaled non-additive fitness. Thus a single adaptive walk is expressed as the dynamics of a particle in this space. We drew the ''hill-climbing'' vector field, where each vector represents the most probable step for a walker in a single step. Almost all of the walkers are expected to move along streams of vectors existing on a particular surface that overlies the (x, y)-plane, toward the neighborhood of a characteristic point at which a mutation-selection-random drift balance is reached. We could theoretically predict this reachable point in the case of random sampling search strategy.},

  Abstract                 = {Based on the theory of fitness distributions on a Mt. Fuji-type fitness landscape in a multivalued sequence space (Aita and Husimi, 1996, J. theor. Biol. 182, 469-485), we investigated the properties of adaptive walks on the ideal landscape in the case of a cloning-screening-type evolution experiment. We modeled that an adaptive walk is performed by repetition of the evolution cycle composed of the mutagenesis process generating random d-fold point mutants of population size N and the selection process looking for the fittest mutant among them. While an adaptive walk is described in a sequence space, we simplified the description as follows. We mapped the landscape in an x-y plane, where x and y represent a normalized Hamming distance from the global peak and a scaled fitness, respectively. An adaptive walk is described as a trajectory in the plane. The most certain step for a walker to move in a single evolution cycle is represented by a vector in the plane. Then. a walker moves along the streams in the vector field determined by d and N. The walker performs fast hill-climbing until a ''trap-line'', which traverses the plane. Subsequently, the walker is likely to gel trapped in an ''apparent local optimum''. To continue the walk, apparent local optima must be eliminated by resetting d smaller or N larger. Therefore, for the fastest walk, the optimal schedule of the d-values (initially large d, then small ri) is effective, although the economical walk with high cost-performance is different. If a real landscape is just of the hit. Fuji-type, the walk with the highest cost-performance will be performed by scanning site-directed optimization through all sites. However, in the case of the rough Mt. Fuji-type, which seems to be more realistic, the walking method we have examined will be effective for a walker to sidestep true local optima.

  Abstract                 = {In early stages of primary succession, colonizing plants can create resource patches that influence the abundance and distribution of other species. To test whether different colonizing shrubs generate contrasting patches on coastal sand dunes, we compared soil characteristics and light availability under the nitrogen-fixing shrub Lupinus arboreus, under the non-nitrogen-fixing shrub Artemisia pycnocephala, and between shrubs on dunes at a site in northern California. Concentrations of inorganic nitrogen and net nitrogen mineralization rates were generally 1-10 times greater in soil under Lupinus than under Artemisia or between shrubs. Soil water content was mostly lower under shrubs. Mean photon flux density near ground level was reduced by at least 80% at greater than or equal to 35 cm inside shrub canopies. Topography appeared to have more effect on soil moisture but less direct effect on nitrogen availability than did Lupinus. However, Lupinus probably increases nitrogen levels more on higher, drier dunes. Microhabitats under and between nitrogen-fixing shrubs constitute a mosaic of individually poor but complementary patches in which high levels of light and moderate levels of soil nitrogen are present but tend not to occur together.},

The synthesis presented is based on a major axis, coexistence in spatially homogeneous vs. heterogeneous competitive environments, along which the theory can be organized. The resulting framework integrates such key concepts as niche theory, spatial heterogeneity and spatial scale(s) of coexistence.

  Abstract                 = {Patch occupancy theory predicts that a trade-off between competition and dispersal should lead to regional coexistence of competing species. Empirical investigations, however, find local coexistence of superior and inferior competitors, an outcome that cannot be explained within the patch occupancy framework because of the decoupling of local and spatial dynamics. We develop two-patch metapopulation models that explicitly consider the interaction between competition and dispersal. We show that a dispersal-competition trade-off can lead to local coexistence provided the inferior competitor is superior at colonizing empty patches as well as immigrating among occupied patches. Immigration from patches that the superior competitor cannot colonize rescues the inferior competitor from extinction in patches that both species colonize. Too much immigration, however, can be detrimental to coexistence. When competitive asymmetry between species is high, local coexistence is possible only if the dispersal rate of the inferior competitor occurs below a critical threshold. If competing species have comparable colonization abilities and the environment is otherwise spatially homogeneous, a superior ability to immigrate among occupied patches cannot prevent exclusion of the inferior competitor. If, however, biotic or abiotic factors create spatial heterogeneity in competitive rankings across the landscape, local coexistence can occur even in the absence of a dispersal-competition trade-off. In fact, coexistence requires that the dispersal rate of the overall inferior competitor not exceed a critical threshold. Explicit consideration of how dispersal modifies local competitive interactions shifts the focus from the patch occupancy approach with its emphasis on extinction-colonization dynamics to the realm of source-sink dynamics. The key to coexistence in this framework is spatial variance in fitness. Unlike in the patch occupancy framework, high rates of dispersal can undermine coexistence, and hence diversity, by reducing spatial variance in fitness.},

We draw an analogy between the epidemiological categorization of individuals (infected, susceptible, latent and resistant) and the patch structure of a spatially heterogeneous landscape (occupied-suitable, empty-suitable, occupied-unsuitable and empty-unsuitable). This approach allows one to consider life-history attributes that influence persistence in patchy environments (e.g., longevity, colonization ability) in concert with extrinsic processes (e.g., disturbances, succession) that lead to spatial heterogeneity in patch suitability. It also allows the incorporation of seed banks and other dormant life forms, thus broadening patch occupancy dynamics to include sink habitats. We use the model to investigate how equilibrium patch occupancy is influenced by four critical parameters: colonization rate? extinction rate, disturbance frequency and the rate of habitat succession. This analysis leads to general predictions about how the temporal scaling of patch succession and extinction-colonization dynamics influences long-term persistence. We apply the model to herbaceous, early-successional species that inhabit open patches created by periodic disturbances. We predict the minimum disturbance frequency required far viable management of such species in the Florida scrub ecosystem. (C) 2001 Academic Press.},

In particular, reliable estimates of several critical forest canopy structure metrics, including canopy bulk density, canopy height, canopy fuel weight, and canopy base height, are required to accurately map the spatial distribution of canopy fuels and model fire behavior over the landscape. The use of airborne laser scanning (LIDAR), a high-resolution active remote sensing technology, provides for accurate and efficient measurement of three-dimensional forest structure over extensive areas. In this study, regression analysis was used to develop predictive models relating a variety of LIDAR-based metrics to the canopy fuel parameters estimated from inventory data collected at plots established within stands of varying condition within Capitol State Forest, in western Washington State. Strong relationships between LIDAR-derived metrics and field-based fuel estimates were found for all parameters [sqrt(crown fuel weight): R-2=0.86; In(crown bulk density): R-2=0.84; canopy base height: R-2=0.77; canopy height: R-2=0.98]. A cross-validation procedure was used to assess the reliability of these models. LIDAR-based fuel prediction models can be used to develop maps of critical canopy fuel parameters over forest areas in the Pacific Northwest. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Increases in photosynthesis of leaves remaining after defoliation may result from shifts in leaf photosynthetic characteristics or from an improved light penetration in the canopy. However, few studies have tried to estimate the relative contribution of these factors to mitigating the negative effects of defoliation. We present a quantitative framework for such an analysis. 2, In a field and greenhouse experiment, plants of the rain forest understorey palm Chamaedorea elegans were subjected to three levels of defoliation (0, 50 or 66\% of leaves removed) and, in the greenhouse, grown at two irradiances (5 or 16\% of daylight, 'low light' and 'high light' hereafter). For each plant, leaf photosynthesis and light penetration in the canopy were measured and these data were used to calculate whole-canopy carbon gain. 3, Defoliation significantly increased the light available to the remaining leaves. In the field and in the 'high-light' greenhouse plants, defoliation also resulted in an increase in the light-saturated photosynthesis per unit leaf area (P-max), although in the 'Iow-light' plants this was not the case. 4, A sensitivity analysis revealed that in the 'Iow-light' plants, a proportional increase in leaf P-max did not result in increased canopy-level carbon gain, while in the 'high-light' and field plants, it did. This suggests that the lack of plasticity in P-max in response to defoliation, at low light, may be the appropriate pattern to maximize carbon gain. 5, Defoliated plants had 10-18\% more average photosynthesis per unit leaf area (P-area) than the control plants, and this increase was mostly the result of an improved light penetration in the canopy. 6. A relatively small fraction (5-30\%) of the total estimated loss in canopy carbon gain caused by the removal of leaves was compensated for by an increase in P-area. This suggests that in rain forest understorey plants, an increase in diurnal photosynthesis of remaining leaves has limited potential for mitigating the negative effects of defoliation.}

  Abstract                 = {We analyzed to what extent and by what mechanisms plants of the tropical understory palm Chamaedorea elegans are able to mitigate the negative effects of defoliation on performance (i.e., plant size, total growth, leaf lamina growth, and reproduction) and how this is related to light availability. For this purpose we developed a new approach that allowed us to quantify the performance of defoliated plants relative not only to the performance of undamaged plants, but also relative to the estimated performance of hypothetical defoliated plants that do not exhibit any. mechanisms of compensatory growth. The latter provides a way to quantify the adaptive value of compensation with reference to a hypothetical noncompensating alternative state. C. elegans plants were grown in a greenhouse at two light levels (5% and 16% of natural daylight) and subjected to five defoliation treatments (a control and four levels of defoliation). Defoliation was repeated every three months. Growth analysis revealed that defoliated plants allocated considerably more mass to the production of leaf laminas (f(lam)) than control plants, at the expense of allocation to other organs, particularly reproductive structures. Average growth rates per unit leaf area (NAR) and per unit plant mass (RGR), both measured on the basis of above-ground mass, increased with the level of defoliation at high light but not at low light. We estimated that the increases in f(lam) and NAR enabled C. elegans to compensate for part of the potential loss in performance caused by defoliation, even in cases where their RGR values were lower than those of control plants. Sensitivity analysis indicated that changes in NAR contributed more to this compensation than f(lam), but the importance of f(lam) increased with defoliation level and with decreasing light availability. The degree of compensation was higher in the high- than in the low-light treatment, suggesting that the possession of traits associated with compensatory growth. may be more important in sunny than in shaded environments. The degree of compensation differed depending on the measure of performance. Defoliated plants fully compensated for the potential reduction in lamina growth but compensated for <20% of estimated loss in reproductive output. Since survival of C. elegans plants appears to be. strongly associated with their total leaf area, the greater compensation for lamina growth is important in relation to population dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {At savanna woodland sites in southern Texas, discrete clusters of woody plants form in herbaceous clearings following the invasion of mesquite {(Prosopis} glandulosa var. glandulosa), an arborescent legume. The growth rate of these clusters has been shown to vary with precipitation and size. Based on field data and a knowledge of mechanisms of woody-plant successional processes, a simulation model was developed to estimate the rates of growth and development of these woody-plant assemblages on sandy-loam uplands under different precipitation regimes. In the simulation, the establishment of other woody species beneath invading Prosopis occurred within 10-15 yr. As a cluster developed around the Prosopis nucleus, species richness increased rapidly for 35-45 yr and became asymptotic at 10 species per cluster. The estimated age of the oldest Prosopis plant found in clusters was 172-217 yr. However, model-derived size-age relationships predicted that most (90\%) clusters and mesquite plants at the site are less than 100 yr old. A lack of field evidence of mortality among large clusters and Prosopis plants suggests that populations are young and expanding geometrically. There was no evidence of density-dependent restrictions on recruitment or expansion. Thus, as new clusters are initiated and existing clusters expand, coalescence to continuous canopy woodlands may eventually occur. Predicted long-term mean radial trunk growth of Prosopis (0.8-1.9 mm/yr) was reasonable in comparison with short-term field measurements on Prosopis in other, more-mesic systems (2-4 mm/yr). Model output was also consistent with historical observations suggesting that the conversion of savannas to woodlands in the Rio Grande Plains has been recent and coincident with both heavy grazing by livestock and seasonal shifts in precipitation that began in the late 1800s. This is in agreement with woody-plant invasions documented in other North American arid and semiarid systems by the direct aging of woody plants.},

  Abstract                 = {Over several fruiting seasons, the fates of seeds placed in recently burnt habitats, and one habitat unburnt for more than 10 years, were used to examine the impact of fire on seed predation levels in the endangered species Grevillea caleyi from southeastern Australia. Native rodents. Rattus fuscipes, and macropods. Wallabia bicolor, were responsible for seed losses after seeds fell below parent plants. Virtually all seeds (99-100%) were lost to these mammals for the first two fruiting seasons after a wildfire. Such losses usually exceeded pre-fire loss estimates or estimates from a site unburnt for more than 10 years. There was no significant difference in seed losses to mammals in three recently burnt sites over four fruiting seasons. However, there was a slight trend for some seed escape (seed losses 91-97%) acid a slowing of the rate of seed loss in the fourth fruiting season after fire. Time since the last fire accounted for some 60% of the estimated variation in magnitude of seed losses to mammals. These results suggest that in the endangered, fire-sensitive G. caleyi, replenishment of the soil seed bank after fire is severely retarded by mammal seed predation. The implications are that after a fire, G. caleyi should be protected from the risk of a future fire well beyond three times the primary juvenile period in the species or local extinction will occur.

  Abstract                 = {The role seed predators play in influencing the dynamics of plant populations has been little studied in Australia. The interaction of ant dispersal and seed predation on the soil seedbank in six shrubby species of Grevillea from the Sydney region of southeastern Australia was examined in selective exclusion experiments, seed array trials and placement of single seeds on the ground. Two distinct seed types in Grevillea were examined and different seed dispersal and post-dispersal seed predation patterns were associated with each: (a) seeds lacking an elaiosome were not attractive to ants and annual seed losses of between 82 and 95% were found in vegetation unburnt for greater than 8 years. Native rodents, Rattus fuscipes, and macropods, Wallabia bicolor, were responsible for these seed losses; (b) seeds with an elaiosome were rapidly handled by ants. Two functional types of ants were recognised. Most encounters were by ants that were small (Local) relative to seed size and these ants simply removed the elaiosome in situ or moved seeds only small distances (< 20 cm). Some 0-24% of ant/seed encounters were by large (Removalist) ant species that were capable of moving seeds back to nests. In addition, Rattus fuscipes and Wallabia bicolor consumed at least 32-68% of seeds of Grevillea species with an elaiosome. Ants may reduce the overall levels of seed predation where seeds moved by Removalist ant species escape predation and are deposited in safe sites, hence allowing more seeds to reach the persistent soil seedbank. Mammals do not consume all seeds when ants are excluded, allowing for the potential for some seed escape from predation after seeds are discarded by Local ant species.},

Samples of five seeder and four sprouter populations of A. linearis were examined by horizontal starch gel electrophoresis to assess the amount of genetic differentiation within and between sprouting and seeding populations, and to determine the extent of gene flow between the populations. Leaf extracts were surveyed for ten enzymes and gene products revealed genetic variation at 13 (76%) of 17 protein coding loci. Allele frequency differences were found between sprouting and seeding populations and genetic distance values show that the sprouters are grouped separate from the seeders, thus providing support for the morphological data on which the above mentioned hypothesis is based. It is evident that evolution operates at the population level in A. linearis.},

  Abstract                 = {We described 38 relictual old-growth stands - with data on the mortality, regeneration, floristic richness, fuel load and disease incidence in our study area in the Tahoe Basin of California and Nevada. The stands are within the lower and upper montane zones (1900-2400 in a.s.l.) and they are rare, occupying < 2% of the land in the Basin's watershed. Correlation matrices and ANOVAs of forest types and conifer species with environmental gradients revealed significant relationships with elevation, distance east of the Sierran crest, slope aspect, annual precipitation, date of complete snow melt, litter depth and degree of soil profile development. Pathogens, parasites and wood-boring insects were present on 23% of living trees; 16% of all trees were dead. We compared these stands to a reconstruction of pre-contact Basin forests and to ecologically analogous old-growth forests of Baja California that have never experienced fire suppression management. Currently, overstorey trees (> 180 yr old) in the Basin stands have ca. 33% cover, 54 m(2).ha(-1) basal area and 107 individuals.ha(-1), values very similar to reconstructions of pre-contact Basin forests and to modern Baja California forests. Understorey trees (60-180 yr old), however, are several times more dense than historic levels and species composition is strongly dominated by A. concolor, regardless of the overstorey composition. The ratio of Pinus : Abies has increased - and the age structure of extant stands predicts that it will continue to increase - from approximately 1:1 in pre-contact time to 1:7 within the next century. Disease incidence and mortality in Baja forests were lower. Although we quantitatively defined current Basin old-growth forests - in terms of stand structure - we realize that our definition will differ from that of both past and future old-growth forests unless management protocols are changed.},

  Abstract                 = {This study attempts to show the dynamics of the canopy structure of the Mediterranean pioneer shrub Lavandula stoechas after man-made perturbation (i.e, grazing). The development of the vertical structure of the shrub was studied by harvesting the canopy of plants of 2-6 yr old in horizontal layers. The supportive biomass of the canopy was concentrated near the base at all ages. Leaf biomass was evenly distributed all over the vertical profile in 2- and 3-yr old plants. In 4-yr old plants it presented a maximum near the top of the canopy. For 5-yr old plants a structural transition started with leaf profiles showing a bimodal distribution. Leaf biomass predominated near the base in 6-yr old plants, suggesting that the transition was completed. Three canopy stages in the growth processes of the plant were recognized after the first year of growth: in the first one (from 2 to 3 yr old) both leaf and supportive biomass increased; in the second one (from 3 to 4 yr) leaf biomass remained stable and there was an increase in supportive biomass until the plants reached a 'mature stage', in 4-yr old plants; finally, in 5- and 6-yr old plants there was a decrease both in leaf and supportive biomass and plant structure showed evidence of senescence. Early transitions from seedling to l-yr old plant and from this to 2- to 3-yr old plants were less obvious. The leaf/supportive biomass ratio always decreased with plant age, from 1.88 in seedlings to 0.01 in 6-yr old plants. Biomass density followed the pattern of supportive biomass, with an increase from 1.7 g/dm(3) (2-yr old plants) to 2.4 g/dm(3) (4-yr old plants). Thereafter, biomass density decreased to 0.6 g/dm3 (6-yr old plants).},

  Abstract                 = {A general representation of multilocus selection is extended to allow recombination to depend on genotype. The equations simplify if modifier alleles have small effects on recombination. The evolution of such modifiers only depends on how they alter recombination between the selected loci, and does not involve dominance in modifier effects. The net selection on modifiers can be found explicitly if epistasis is weak relative to recombination. This analysis shows that recombination can be favoured in two ways: because it impedes the response to epistasis which fluctuates in sign, or because it facilitates the response to directional selection. The first mechanism is implausible, because epistasis must change sign over periods of a few generations: faster or slower fluctuations favour reduced recombination. The second mechanism requires weak negative epistasis between favourable alleles, which may either be increasing, or held in check by mutation. The selection (s(i)) on recombination modifiers depends on the reduction in additive variance of log(fitness) due to linkage disequilibria (v(1), < 0), and on non-additive variance in log(fitness) (V'(2), V'(3),.. for epistasis between 2, 3.. loci). For unlinked loci and pairwise epistasis, s(i) = -(v(1) + 4V(2)/3)delta r, where delta r is the average increase in recombination caused by the modifier. The approximations are checked against exact calculations for three loci, and against Charlesworth's analyses of mutation/selection balance (1990), and directional selection (1993). The analysis demonstrates a general relation between selection on recombination and observable components of fitness variation, which is open to experimental test.},

  Abstract                 = {Aim In this study, we evaluated the fire-forest mosaic of a mixed conifer forest landscape by testing the hypothesis that pre-fire suppression fire regime parameters vary with species composition (tree species), and environment (i.e. slope aspect, slope position, elevation). Location Our study was conducted in the 1587 ha Cub Creek Research Natural Area (CCRNA), Lassen National Forest, CA, USA. Methods We quantified the return interval, seasonal occurrence, size, rotation period, and severity of fires using dendroecology. Results Slope aspect, potential soil moisture, forest composition, and fire regime parameters in our study area co-vary. Median composite and point fire return intervals (FRI) were longest on higher, cooler, more mesic, north-facing (NF) slopes covered with white fir (Abies concolor), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)-white fir, and red fir (A. magnifica)-white fir forests, shortest on the dry, south-facing (SF) slopes covered with ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)-white fir forests and intermediate on west-facing slopes dominated by white fir-sugar pine (P. lambertiana)-incense cedar (Libocedrus decurrens) forests. The spatial pattern for length of fire rotation (FR) was the same as that for FRI. Fires in CCRNA mixed conifer forests occurred mainly (90%) in the dormant season. Size of burns in CCRNA mixed conifer forests were generally small (mean = 106 ha), however, during certain drought years widespread fires burned across fuel breaks and spread throughout the watershed. Fire severity was mainly high on upper slopes, low on lower slopes and moderate and low severity on middle slopes. Patterns of fire severity also varied with slope aspect. Fire frequency decreased dramatically in CCRNA after 1905. Conclusions In CCRNA, fire regime parameters [e.g. FRI, fire extent, FR, fire severity] varied widely with species composition, slope aspect and slope position. There was also temporal variation in fire extent with the most widespread fires occurring during drought years. The important contributions of topography and climate to variation in the fire regime indicates that exogenous factors play a key role in shaping the fire-forest structure mosaic and that the fire-forest structure mosaic is more variable, less predictable and less stable than previously thought. Finally, some characteristics of the fire regime (i.e. fire severity, season of burn) in CCRNA are different than those described for other mixed conifer forests and this suggests that there are geographical differences in mixed conifer fire regimes along the Pacific slope.},

Four populations were from the Ottawa River region and four from the St. Lawrence Lowlands region, while two populations were at the margin of the natural range of the species in Quebec, from the Abitibi region and Anticosti Island. Significant differences among populations were detected for each character. Estimates of repeatability of these traits were relatively high, suggesting substantial genotypic control over them. These estimates were consistent from population to population. Results of multivariate analyses suggest that populations from the Ottawa River region are similar to those from the St. Lawrence region, with populations from these regions diverging only in cone scale length. However, populations from the St. Lawrence region were more distinct from each other than those from the Ottawa River region. The population from Abitibi deviates considerably from the other populations, suggesting habitat-selection pressures acting at the margin of the natural range of the species under continental conditions. Finally, no general geographical trend was detected in the observed variation.},

The level of genetic diversity was lower in the populations of the St. Lawrence lowlands than in those of western Quebec. This observation will help in guiding the selection program of the eastern white pine improvement program under way in Quebec. Genetic differentiation among sampled populations was weak and accounted for only 2% of the total diversity. The estimate of gene flow was very high, resulting in low values for genetic distances among populations. Only one locus showed a heterogeneity of allelic frequencies among populations after the Bonferroni procedure was applied for simultaneous statistical tests. A cluster analysis based on genetic distances among populations revealed that the Anticosti and Abitibi populations, located at the limit of the natural range of white pine, were similar to populations from regions that were geographically the most distant.},

We used maximum likelihood and Akaike's Information Criterion to compare linear, quadratic, saturating, and null models of community response to repeating burning. We did not find a relationship between species richness, diversity or flowering stem density and fire frequency. Tree density was related to fire frequency and may represent an indirect pathway for fire effects on understory characteristics. While we found no support for the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, an analysis of our experimental design indicated that we had low statistical power. We develop the hypothesis that a saturating model of response to fire best describes understory species richness in our system.

  Abstract                 = {Six understory species from five pine flatwood sites and six understory species from five hardwood hammock sites were harvested for biomass analyses to compare potential flammability between two ecosystems in the south-eastern coastal plain of the United States. Plant components were separated into live and dead foliage, accumulated litter on and under the plant, and small and large stems. Foliar biomass was further analysed for moisture content, volatile solid content, and energy content. Statistical analyses revealed differences among species and between ecosystems. Serenoa repens plants present a wildfire hazard because they contain greater biomass than other species studied. Ilex glabra and Lyonia ferruginea are also hazardous to wildland-urban interface (WUI) structures because they have greater foliar energy content than other species studied. Callicarpa americana plants present the least wildfire hazard to WUI structures. We conclude that differences in flammability among species exist, but the causes of flammability are different among species. In addition, species in the same genus do not always have the same flammability. Based on measured characteristics, understory plants in pine flatwoods have greater ignitability, sustainability and combustibility than understory plants in hardwood hammocks. However, the measurements for consumability were similar between ecosystems.}

  Abstract                 = {Species distribution and abundance patterns in the southern Cascades are influenced by both environmental gradients and fire regimes. Little is known about fire regimes and variation in fire regimes may not be independent of environmental gradients or vegetation patterns. In this study, we analyze variation in fire regime parameters (i.e., return interval, season, size, severity, and rotation period) with respect to forest composition, elevation, and potential soil moisture in a 2042 ha area of montane forest in the southern Cascades in the Thousand Lakes Wilderness (TLW). Fire regime parameters varied with forest composition, elevation, and potential soil moisture. Median composite and point fire return intervals were shorter (4-9 yr, 14-24 yr) in low elevation and more xeric white fir (Abies concolor)-sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) and white fir-Jeffrey pine (P. jeffreyi) and longest (20-37 yr, 20-47 yr) in mesic high elevation lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and red fir (Abies magnifica)-mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) forests. Values for mid-elevation red fir-white fir forests were intermediate. The pattern for fire rotation lengths across gradients was the same as for fire return intervals. The percentage of fires that occurred during the growing season was inversely related to elevation and potential soil moisture. Mean fire sizes were larger in lodgepole pine forests (405 ha) than in other forest groups (103-151 ha). In contrast to other parameters, fire severity did not vary across environmental and compositional gradients and >50% of all forests burned at high severity with most of the remainder burning at moderate severity. Since 1905, fire regimes have become similar at all gradient positions because of a policy of suppressing fire and fire regime modification will lead to shifts in landscape scale vegetation patterns.}

  Abstract                 = {Two fire-response syndromes can be described for species of the vegetation of Mediterranean-climate, fires as individuals. Reseeders are killed by fire and must reestablish through germination and establishment of seedlings. Of the Western Australian plant families analyzed for fire-response strategies, 50\% of the Proteaceae, 50% of the Restionaceae, 45% of the Orchidaceae, and 25% of the Epacridaceae are resprouter species. Within genera of the Proteaceae, the proportions of resprouters include Adenanthos (56%), Hakea (52\%), Dryandra (35\%), and Grevillea (31\%). Within Banksia, 49\% are resprouters, and it appears that the reseeding syndrome is the derived character in this genus. The proportion of resprouters within southwestern Western Australian plant communities ranges from 66% to 80%. These percentages are generally higher than in more and parts of Western Australia and in comparable plant communities from other Mediterranean-type climates of the world. The relatively high proportion of resprouters within plant families and within plant communities probably indicates that the Western Australian vegetation experiences a harsher fire stress regime than do other Mediterranean-type climate areas. Western Australian plant communities have their highest diversity in the early years after fire, when the vegetation contains a higher number of reseeding species and individuals. Seed banks are dominated by the seeds of reseeders. There are no basic differences in mean seed mass, viability, or germinability of seeds between resprouting species and reseeding species, but reseeders tend to have narrower optimum germination temperature regimes. Establishment success is related more to seed mass, seedling size, and leaf ecophysiology and morphology than to fire-response strategy. Reseeder seedlings tend to grow faster than do resprouter seedlings. Basic shrub morphology differs, with reseeders generally being umbrella shaped and resprouters urn shaped. Reseeding species most commonly have a shallow, fibrous root system. Resprouters have a massive, deeply penetrating root system. Shoot:root ratios of first-year seedlings and mature plants are higher for reseeders. Resprouter seedlings store starch in root tissue at a much greater rate than do reseeder seedlings. Although the concentrations of essential nutrients in seedlings are not different between fire-response types, reseeders tend to conserve nutrients to a greater extent through leaf retention. Reseeders tend to produce greater numbers of flowers and greater amounts of floral rewards, but the breeding systems, which lead to the higher seed set in reseeders, can vary between strict outcrossing and considerable selfing. Reseeding species are not likely to be wind pollinated. Species survival in a fire-prone environment can involve a wide range of combinations of attributes. It appears that in Western Australian reseeder species the lack of an ability to resprout is compensated for by a number of other structural and functional features. Knowledge of the fire-response strategies of species of southwestern Western Australia can influence fire-regime management, conservation of rare species, and restoration of vegetation after disturbance. Further knowledge of the fire-response strategies of species of the southwestern Western Australian flora should result in better management of natural and restored plant communities of the region.},

  Abstract                 = {The patterns of abundance generated by a simple stochastic birth-death-immigration model are described in order to characterize the diversity of neutral communities of ecologically equivalent species. Diversity is described by species number S and the variance of frequency or log abundance q(similar to). The frequency distribution of abundance is very generally lognormal, skewed to the left by immigration and resembling descriptions of natural communities. Increased immigration and community size always cause S to increase. Their effect on q(similar to) is more complicated, but given biologically reasonable assumptions, S and q(similar to) will be positively correlated in most circumstances. Larger samples contain more species; the graph of log S on log individuals, equivalent to a species-area curve, is generally convex upward but becomes linear with a slope of about +0.25 when immigration is low and births exceed deaths. When individuals invade a new, vacant environment, both S and q(similar to) increase through rime. Thus, a positive correlation between S and q(similar to) will usually be generated when sites of differing size or age are surveyed. At equilibrium, communities maintain roughly constant levels of S and q(similar to) but change in composition through time; composition may remain similar, however, for many generations. Many prominent patterns observed in natural communities can therefore be generated by a strictly neutral model. This does not show that community structure is determined exclusively by demographic stochasticity, but rather demonstrates the necessity for an appropriate null model when functional hypotheses are being tested.},

  Abstract                 = {Concentrations of starch in roots of seeder species of Erica from the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa were found to be considerably less than in resprouters. Shoot starch was highly variable but mean values were similar in both seeder and resprouter species of Erica. Three distinct patterns of starch storage in roots were recognized. All seeder species fell within definitions of Categories 1 (narrow major and minor parenchymatous rays, one to two cells wide with no inter-ray storage) or 2 (thick major rays up to seven cells wide and thin minor rays with small amounts of inter-ray storage) whereas resprouter species were consistently within Categories 2 or 3 (broad major and minor rays, up to eight cells wide and conspicuous inter-ray starch storage). Results are discussed in light of similar studies of the related Epacridaceae. 'Mixed' species (i.e. with seeder or resprouter individuals present, often in distinct populations) were always classified as belonging to Category 2. Studies of populations of three 'mixed' species confirmed that seeder forms had consistently lower amounts of root starch than resprouters. Rays of xylem parenchyma were the main sites for starch storage in roots of both seeders and resprouters and greater proportions of cross-sectional area of roots were consistently devoted to such storage tissues in resprouter forms of the three 'mixed' species. Analyses of a number of seeder and resprouter Erica coccinea populations showed that differences in amounts of realised and potential root starch storage are best explained by the effect of regeneration behaviour rather than by among-population variability.},

The seeders commenced flowering earlier, achieved three-fold higher shoot:root ratios but accumulated much smaller root starch reserves than the resprouters. The resprouting potential of L. verticillatus was 'bud initiation-limited', since progressive shoot removal exhausted the bud-producing potential but did not fully deplete the starch reserves of the root stock. Apparent conversion efficiency of starch to new shoot biomass was 88%. The corresponding response in C. pendulum was 'energy reserve-limited', with shoot removal eliminating root starch but leaving many unexpanded buds. Dendroecological analyses of root xylem growth rings were undertaken on 15 year-old plants of C. pendulum recruiting from seed in unburnt and adjacent periodically burnt habitats. Growth ring extension of burnt plants resumed after each fire at rates faster than their unburnt counterparts, suggesting that improved access by resprouting shoots to light, water and nutrients compensated for destruction of the previous shoot system.},

Seeders, 75 % of the species investigated, possessed a single main stem and a small root system with lateral roots which in most cases did not spread beyond the shoot canopy. Resprouter species were generally multi-stemmed with large lignotuberous root stocks. Certain seeder and resprouter species were intermediate in form and showed small root systems and basally branched main stems. Amounts of starch in roots of seeders (1.9+/-0.5 mg starch g d. wt per root) were much less than in resprouters (14.1+/-3.3) whereas amounts in shoots were similar (1.9+/-0.5 and 16+/-0.6 mg starch g d. wt per shoot, respectively). Starch storage in roots was mostly confined to rays of xylem parenchyma and inter-ray xylem parenchyma and the greater storage capacity of resprouters was generally due to broader rays. Growth zones in root xylem ranged from clear, verifiable annual rings, as in many seeder species, to indistinct growth zones, typical of many resprouter species. Shoot:root dry weight ratios were higher in seeders than resprouters. The study suggests that speciation within the Epacridaceae into seeder and resprouter forms involved divergent differentiation in terms of morphology, shoot:root dry weight ratio root storage of starch.

The Mediterranean Basin is particularly appropriate for this kind of multidisciplinary studies, because of its complex geological history and biological diversity. Here, we investigated chloroplast DNA of Quercus suber populations in order to detect possible relationships between their geographical distribution and the palaeogeographical history of the western Mediterranean domain. We analysed 110 cork oak populations, covering the whole distribution range of the species, by 14 chloroplast microsatellite markers, among which eight displayed variation among populations. We identified five haplotypes whose distribution is clearly geographically structured. Results demonstrated that cork oak populations have undergone a genetic drift geographically consistent with the Oligocene and Miocene break-up events of the European–Iberian continental margin and suggested that they have persisted in a number of separate microplates, currently found in Tunisia, Sardinia, Corsica, and Provence, without detectable chloroplast DNA modifications for a time span of over 15 million years. A similar distribution pattern of mitochondrial DNA of Pinus pinaster supports the hypothesis of such long-term persistence, in spite of Quaternary climate oscillations and of isolation due to insularity, and suggests that part of the modern geographical structure of Mediterranean populations may be traced back to the Tertiary history of taxa.},

The relative allocation to resprouting vs seeding in woody plant communities is dictated by the nature of disturbance regimes. Resprouting is the predominant response to the least severe disturbance regimes, but is also a common response in disturbance regimes of high severity, those that destroy most or all above-ground biomass, and which occur at medium to high frequency. The response to disturbance either by resprouting or seeding is dictated by the site's productivity. We present a comprehensive model for relative allocation to resprouting vs seeding across a range of disturbance regimes. Competition between plants that mostly seed vs those that mostly resprout should accentuate differences in allocation along a gradient of disturbance frequency. However the patchy nature of disturbance in time and space, coupled with gene flow among populations undergoing different disturbance regimes, ensures that it is unlikely that either resprouting or seeding will be the sole response in most plant communities at most disturbance frequencies. Additional influences on resprouting in woody plant communities include changes in allocation during the lifespan of individual plants and phylogenetic constraints that are expressed as biogeographic patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {Serotiny is a key life history trait in fire-prone habitats that is favored in plants that experience stand-replacing fires within their average life span. Although variation in fire frequency has been the focus of most studies attempting to understand variation in serotiny among populations and species of plants, other factors can select against serotiny. One agent in particular that can select against serotiny is an efficient pre-dispersal seed predator that eats a large fraction of the seeds held in the canopy. To test whether selection by such a predator selects against scrutiny, we compared levels of serotiny in fire-adapted Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta ssp. latifolia) in five ranges lacking its dominant pre-dispersal seed predator, the pine squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) to 344 stands with pine squirrels. Where pine squirrels were absent, the frequency of serotiny was consistently near 100%, whereas where squirrels were present, the frequency was variable, rarely approached the high levels found in areas without squirrels, and averaged much less than 50%. This indicates that squirrels select against serotiny and that, in the absence of squirrels, the frequency of serotiny would probably be uniformly higher throughout much of the Rocky Mountains. Because serotiny levels also influence the density of seedlings following a fire, squirrels, by selecting strongly against scrutiny, have the potential to alter the early stages and perhaps the course of succession and various community attributes.},

Evaluation of the research approaches used to assess ecological effects of harvesting thus has relevance to a diverse range of ecological questions that address large-scale and human impacts on the environment. 2. We measured the frequency of approaches, and also design and statistical issues, in assessments of harvesting effects on three response variables (tree regeneration, vertebrates and water) in two major native forests of south-east Australia. Our evaluation was based on 124 documents that contain unique, field-based research and that represent the complete written record (published and unpublished) of relevant research prior to mid-2002. 3. The dominant approach was contrasts between manipulated stands, nearly always involving mature and old-growth stands as the reference or control. In studies of tree regeneration, focus on wood-production objectives was apparent in the relatively frequent use of stocking standards, and in the use of between- and within-stand contrasts without a control condition. Comparatively greater use of models in vertebrate and water studies suggested more frequent integration of generic principles and, in water studies, reflected strong collective knowledge based on the repeated use of BACI-type designs (i.e. before-after, control-impact) or long-term data sets. 4. Statistical issues such as poor reporting of experimental designs and of sample statistics were common. Explicit hypotheses were rare, and there was no evidence of definition of critical effect sizes, use of power analysis or use of non-classical statistical approaches (e.g. Bayesian inference). 5. Lack of treatment replication was widespread in between-stand contrasts and less frequent in within-stand contrasts. Inappropriate interpretation of results from non-replicated experimental designs remains an ongoing issue. 6. Synthesis and applications. The amount of information obtainable from stand-level manipulations of forest would substantially increase through greater attention to data quality and experimental protocols. Studies require broader experimental contexts, including their potential place in meta-replication frameworks. Increasingly, constraints of large-scale manipulations necessitate the integration of data and the acknowledgement of uncertainty in formalized systems (e.g. Bayesian methods and adaptive management frameworks). Our evaluation suggests the alternative is a perpetuation of short-term, isolated studies that repeat errors and have limited potential to refine knowledge on the ecological effects of timber harvesting and other similarly scaled disturbances.},

  Abstract                 = {The evolution of a selectively neutral modifier of recombination is studied under different conditions of selection on the major genes. In a finite population a simulation study is carried out in which the phenotype is computed additively from the genotype at twenty genes. The fitness is taken to be a function of the phenotype and we show that when this function is very jagged, low recombination has a strong advantage. When the function is smooth and of the disruptive-selection kind, high recombination may be favored in both finite and very large populations. In a deterministic numerical study of disruptive selection on two loci it is shown that the evolution of recombination depends on the initial frequencies at the selected loci, on the exact shape of selection and on the strength of the selection. In general, when the selection is disruptive and very strong, it is possible to find conditions under which higher recombination will be favored.},

This review focuses on the ecological relevance Of psi(min) as a reflection of overall plant hydraulic strategy. The focus is on plant functional strategies with respect to soil drought, but we conclude with preliminary findings on the role of atmospheric drought.},

  Abstract                 = {In the post-apartheid era, South Africa is experiencing a serious water supply crisis as demand increases from both rural areas and rapidly growing towns and cities. New dams and water transfer schemes are being constructed, but they are both controversial and unlikely to fully satisfy demand. Alien species of trees and plants have invaded many parts of the country, taking over land from indigenous species. These alien species consume much more water than the indigenous vegetation, as well as threatening biodiversity and constituting a significant fire hazard. The Working for Water Programme, established in 1995, and working in partnership with local communities, aims to clear invasive alien species and thus increase water supply. The programme is examined in terms of its impact on environment and the livelihoods of predominantly poor rural communities. Questions are raised about the future sustainability of the programme.

  Abstract                 = {I studied relative abundances, foraging behavior, and foraging habitats of Nuttall's Woodpeckers (Picoides nuttallii) at three California locations. Population sizes at two areas in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada were larger than the population in the Tehachapi Mountains. These differences were attributed to habitat and weather differences. The two areas in the Sierra foothills had milder winters and contained large interior live oaks (Quercus wislizenii) and gray pines (Pinus sabiniana), species used extensively by woodpeckers outside of the breeding season. The Tehachapi area contained few large interior live oaks and no gray pines. All areas contained blue oak (Q. douglasii), used extensively during breeding. Trees actually used for foraging at all locations and during all seasons were larger, on average, than those generally available. Birds foraged by lightly pecking, probing, and gleaning prey from branches < 30 cm in diameter, although the exact methods and substrates varied by study area, season, and year. I found little intersexual variation in either foraging behavior or foraging habitat.},

  Abstract                 = {Though the distribution of global vegetation can generally be predicted from climate, grasslands are an exception. C-4 grassy biomes cover vast areas that are warm enough and wet enough to support closed forests. The extent of this climate mismatch has been revealed by physiologically based global vegetation simulations and by large empirical data sets. Reasons for the existence of grassy biomes have long been debated, polarized into bottom-up (resources) or top-down (fire,herbivory) arguments. Recent studies indicate that both are important, especially in suppressing woody recruits. Grasses are formidable competitors below ground, create highly flammable fuels, and can support large herbivore densities. The net effect on trees is rare and episodic recruitment of adults in tree-fall gaps. The implication is that ecosystem structure and function depend on demographic transitions. Tree cover is increasing and grass/forest boundaries are changing. These changes can have large feedbacks to the earth-atmosphere system. Though progress has been made, there is still great uncertainty in predicting the future of C-4 grassy biomes.},

We tested the prediction by planting seeds from 17 species ranging in weight from 0.1 to 100 mg at a variety of depths in a sand medium. The species were spread across 16 genera and 13 families, all occurring in fire-prone fynbos shrublands of South Africa. Maximum emergence depth was found to scale allometrically with seed weight with an exponent of 0.334, close to the predicted value. We used the allometry to predict recruitment response to experimentally simulated variation in fire intensity. Five species with small (<2 mg) seeds and five with large (>10 mg) seeds were planted at less than or equal to 20-mm and 40-mm depths and exposed to low and high heat treatments and a control. The allometric equation predicted that species with large seeds would be able to emerge from a depth of 40 mm but those with small seeds would not. Only 1% of 481 seedlings from small-seeded species emerged from the 40-mm planting compared with 40% of 626 seedlings from the large-seeded group. The simulated fire treatments killed seeds in shallow, but not deeper, soil layers. At simulated high fire intensities, seedling emergence was poor in small-seeded species but good in large-seeded species, with most seedlings emerging from the 40-mm planting depth. Seed size could be a useful general predictor of recruitment success under different fire intensities in this system. We suggest that allometric relationships in plants deserve wider attention as predictive tools.},

Fire has been burning ecosystems for hundreds of millions of years, helping to shape global biome distribution and to maintain the structure and function of fire-prone communities. Fire is also a significant evolutionary force, and is one of the first tools that humans used to re-shape their world. Here, we review the recent literature, drawing parallels between fire and herbivores as alternative consumers of vegetation. We point to the common questions, and some surprisingly different answers, that emerge from viewing fire as a globally significant consumer that is analogous to herbivory.},

  Abstract                 = {Changes in plant population size are usually attributed to exogenous factors such as drought or herbivore outbreaks. However, in theory, populations may oscillate from endogenous density-dependent causes alone. Under some conditions these oscillations are very irregular and are called chaos. There are very few examples of endogenous oscillations in plants and these are controversial. Large fluctuations in population size occur after fires in many species of Proteaceae in South African and Australian shrublands. These non-sprouting species form single-aged cohorts with recruitment dating from the last fire. Variation in cohort size has usually been attributed to exogenous factors, especially the length of the fire interval, fire season, and post-bum weather conditions. We studied the importance of endogenous density-dependence in generating population oscillations in these proteoid shrubs. Using a variety of approaches, we show that density-dependent reduction in fecundity may lead to endogenous oscillations in some species. We explore the "seeds of chaos" by defining attributes of species and populations most likely to generate endogenous oscillations. Finally, we note the implications of the phenomenon for research in, and management of, these systems.},

  Abstract                 = {The evolutionary causes of sexual dimorphism in plants have not been as widely studied as in animals and the importance of sexual selection in causing dimorphism remains controversial. Sexual selection is most obvious when it favours the evolution of a trait which enhances mating success at the expense of decreased viability. We studied the relationship between floral display (number of inflorescences), pollinator attraction and plant survival in a dioecious shrub, Leucadendron xanthoconus. Pollinator attraction, measured as the number of insect pollinators, increased linearly with floral display in males. However, males with extravagant displays had a higher probability of dying. Our data suggest that male plants are undergoing selection on floral display for increased mating success counterbalanced by selection against plants with extravagant displays. Seed set in females did not increase with floral display, except at very low inflorescence numbers. Nor was female survival correlated with floral display. Because inflorescences are terminal in the species, selection for more inflorescences in males causes increased ramification, thinner terminal branches and smaller leaves. Thus vegetative dimorphism in this species appears to be caused by selection for extravagant floral display in males, but not females. Limits to dimorphism are imposed by survival costs of elaborate display.},

He hypothesised that their current extent was due to extensive forest clearance by Iron Age farmers. We tested the relative importance of fire and climate in determining ecosystem characteristics by simulating potential vegetation of South Africa with and without fire using a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM). The simulations suggest that most of the eastern half of the country could support much higher stem biomass without fire and that the vegetation would be dominated by trees instead of grasses. Fynbos regions in mesic winter rainfall areas would also become tree dominated. We collated results of long term fire exclusion studies to further test the relative importance of fire and climate. These show that grassy ecosystems with rainfall >650mm tend towards fire-sensitive forests with fire excluded. Areas below 650mm showed changes in tree density and size but no trend of changing composition to forest. We discuss recent evidence that C-4 grasslands first appeared between 6 and 8M years BP, long before the appearance of modern humans. However these grassy ecosystems are among the most recently developed biomes on the planet. We briefly discuss the importance of fire in promoting their spread in the late Tertiary.},

  Abstract                 = {Woody plants may be killed by severe disturbance or resprout fr om vegetative tissue. Sprouters can persist at a site through several generations of nonsprouters. Differences in sprouting behavior are therefore important for understanding vegetation dynamics, extinction risks, and woody plant management. Although sprouting appears not to be uniquely correlated with many other intrinsic attributes, such as specific leaf area or breeding systems, a clear correlate is reduced seedling aboveground growth rates from sprouters allocating more to belowground structures. Consequently, sprouters tend to have low seedling recruitment rates, and saplings take longer to reach maturity. Sprouters also tend to have lower seed output than nonsprouters, but comparative studies have seldom taken other trait differences such as plant size into account. Added to these trade-offs between persistence and recruitment, sprouters are often multistemmed and shorter than related nonsprouters and may be outcompeted by them when disturbances are rare. Since sprouters tend to have long generation times, damped demographic trends, and gene flow across generations, it has been suggested that their speciation rates would be low. The available data, primarily from fire-prone Gondwanan shrublands in South Africa, show no strong differences in speciation rates of related sprouters versus seeders. This indicates that ecological factors are important determinants of the evolution of fire life histories. Analysis of disturbance regimes indicates a fundamental ecological correlate: sprouters are favored where disturbance regimes are frequent and severe in comparison to regrowth rates. To bridge the gap between ecology and evolution, data are needed on the genetical differences between related species with contrasting sprouter life histories.},

Recent research shows a growing appreciation for the role of sprouting as a form of persistence in a diversity of ecosystems and tradeoffs between the two regeneration modes.},

  Abstract                 = {The idea that flammability has evolved in many fire-prone communities has been criticised for being group-selectionist. However flammability may enhance inclusive fitness if the resulting fires kill neighbouring less flammable individuals and also open recruitment possibilities. We modelled the evolution of flammability using cellular automata to simulate neighbourhood effects of burning. For plants that survive fire only from unburnt canopies (non-sprouters), increased flammability would cause them to burn to death. Flammability traits can evolve in such species only if they result in fire spreading to kill less flammable neighbours and only if they carry additional fitness benefits. In species that resprout from roots or stem bases after fire, flammability can evolve merely by increasing neighbour mortality but is more likely to do so if the associated traits had other benefits. Most flammability-enhancing traits, both structural and biochemical, are likely to have such additional benefits. We predict that flammability traits will be associated with dense populations where the effect on neighbours is most marked and suggest several tests. Fire has been a key, but neglected, evolutionary force. Alteration of the fire regime through the evolution of flammability, even in a single species contributing heavily to fuel loads, would result in the selective exclusion or admission of other species to an ecosystem depending on the compatibility of their pre-existing traits with fire.},

Seedlings under burnt parental skeletons had short hypocotyls (mean 25 mm) indicating passive dispersal whereas seedlings in the open were more deeply buried (mean 48 mm) by ants. Soil nutrient concentrations at the site of germination were negatively related to depth of burial and distance from parent. Ant dispersal resulted in seedlings emerging in soils with lower nutrient concentrations than passively dispersed seeds. Tissue analysis supported the soil results with lower P content in seedlings from open (ant dispersed) sites. Seedling survival in the first year of establishment was also lower in open sites, but not significantly so. However seedlings were slightly taller in the open. The results of this study, the first on naturally occurring intraspecific variation in myrmecochory, strongly contradict current explanations for the high incidence of myrmecochory in nutrient poor environments.},

Many organisms modulate the availability of resources to other species by causing state changes in biotic or abiotic materials (ecosystem engineering), in the process frequently changing the selection to which the ecosystem engineers and other organisms are exposed (niche construction). We describe growing evidence that organisms have significant nontrophic impacts on ecosystem structure, function, and biodiversity, and outline established means of identifying key species involved in niche construction.

Measurements were made on seedlings vs. adults for all species, and for Rhus spp. in winter vs. summer, and at a warm vs. a cold site. We used four methods to determine the temperature for 50% change in activity or cell death (LT50) of leaves: (1) electrical conductivity (electrolyte leakage into a bathing solution), (2) photosynthetic fluorescent capacity (Fv/Fm), (3) percentage of palisade mesophyll cells stained by fluorescein diacetate vital stain, and (4) visual score of leaf color (Munsell color chart). In all four species seedlings were found to be more sensitive to freezing temperatures than were adults by 1 degrees-3 degrees C. For adults the LT50 ranged from -5 degrees C for Rhus laurina in the summer to -16 degrees C for Rhus ovata in the winter. The LT50 of R. ovata located at a colder inland site was 4 degrees C lower than R, ovata at the warmer coastal site just 4 km apart, suggesting ecotypic differences between R. ovata at the two sites. Both R. laurina and R. ovata underwent significant winter hardening. At the cold site, R. ovata acclimated by 6 degrees C on average, while R. laurina acclimated by only 3 degrees C.

Compared to serotinous pines of the Mediterranean Basin, little detailed information is available on the postfire demography of California closed-cone pines, including P. coulteri. In September 1996 a wildfire burned the 760-ha American Canyon Research Natural Area ( RNA). Using aerial photography, we mapped burn severity of P. coulteri-chaparral woodlands and forests within the RNA. From May to September of 1997, we also quantified seedling establishment and mortality in relation to biophysical site characteristics including fire severity. Seventy-six percent of P. coulteri forests and woodlands experienced high-severity burns, 9% moderate-severity burns, and 15% low-severity or unburned. Of the 53 plots used for seedling counts, 70% were high-severity, 26% moderate-severity, and 4% low-severity. Seedling densities 13 months postfire were low (0.21 m(-2)), but seedling mortality also was low (8.4%). Aerial seed bank size increased from north-facing to south-facing slopes and from high-severity to low-severity burns. Seedling recruitment was unrelated to burn severity and increased with the size of the canopy seed bank ( cone density). Many seedlings established from rodent seed caches; 23% of the seedlings established in clumps from seeds cached by Dipodomys agilis, Chaetodipus californicus and Peromyscus maniculatus. Pinus coulteri seeds have low potential for dispersal by wind, but secondary dispersal by rodents moves seeds away from source trees and into neighboring chaparral. We discuss the potential importance of rodent seed caching to postfire demography of California and Mediterranean serotinous pines.},

Survival of gray pine was higher than that of Coulter pine for comparable values of both variables.},

  Abstract                 = {Phylogenetic relationships among 48 species of Prunus were investigated by means of maximum parsimony analysis of sequence polymorphism from nuclear ITS and chloroplast trnL-trnF spacer DNA. Several genera that have been implicated as close relatives of Prunus in previous studies were utilized as outgroups. The objective of this study was to reconstruct the phylogeny of Prunus with the purpose of reviewing previously described taxonomic relationships and providing a basis for studies of morphological evolution in the genus. Variability and homoplasy are higher in ITS than in trnL-trnF Parsimony analysis of both markers, separately and in combination, supported a close relationship among Exochorda, Oemleria, and Prinsepia but did not support a sister relationship of this clade with Prunus. Prunus is monophyletic and divided into two groups. The first is a strongly supported clade composed of subgenera Padus, Laurocerasus, and Cerasus. None of these subgenera is monophyletic and the trait used to characterize Padus and Laurocerasus, flowers arranged in racemes, can be more broadly interpreted as a synapomorphy for the clade. The second group included the subgenera Amygdalus and Prunus, and sections Microcerasus (subgenus Cerasus), and Penarmeniaca, which has never been assigned to a subgenus, The exclusively North American subgenus Emplectocladus may be an early diverging taxon sister to the second group. Sections Prunus and Armeniaca arc monophyletic with low bootstrap support. Section Penarmeniaca, from Southwestern US, and P. besseyi (section Microcerasus) are sister taxa. A Eurasian origin of Prunus is supported.},

  Abstract                 = {Simulations were used to investigate the effect of season of fire on seedling emergence in Banksia ericifolia and B. serrata. The simulations were based on models of soil-surface moisture in response to rainfall, seedling emergence response to soil moisture and post-fire seed release from fruits as determined by fire intensity, derived from field and laboratory studies. Fires were simulated on the first day of each calendar month for a 50-year period. Levels of post-fire seedling emergence were calculated using rainfall data from the Sydney Observatory for the corresponding period (1931-1980). Trends in seedling emergence as a function of month of fire were examined. Alternative sets of simulations were performed to assess the effect of variations in post-dispersal seed mortality, fire intensity and induced summer dormancy. In both species, mean emergence was affected by season of fire only when a 10% per month level of post-dispersal seed mortality was simulated (there was no fire-season effect at lower mortality levels). Highest predicted emergence occurred after summer fires and lowest emergence after winter fires. A reduction in rate of seed release (lower intensity fire) and induced seed dormancy in summer also had a minor effect with respect to fire-season in B. ericifolia. Reported levels of post-dispersal seed mortality in Banksia species are often high and therefore, the simulations suggested that there will be an effect of fire season on seedling emergence. However, given the high level of year to year variation in seasonal rainfall in the Sydney region, fire-season effects are not predictable in the short term. In the longer term, the timing of fire relative to sequences of wet and dry years may be of equal importance to season of fire in its effect on populations of these banksias.}

Prescribed burning may be used to manipulate fuel to levels that are sub-critical for fire-spread in extreme weather. Effects of variation in area of annual prescribed burning on area of unplanned fires occurring under severe weather and the probability of extinction in three functional groups of shrubs (serotinous and leguminous obligate seeders and serotinous resprouters) were examined. Results of 200 year simulations indicated that restriction of the size of unplanned fires occurred when large (> 30%) areas of the landscape were burnt annually. Risk of extinction in obligate seeders was high at such levels of prescribed burning. Extinction probability was also positively related to frequency of unplanned fires. In resprouters, risk of extinction was unaffected by prescribed fire. The model predicts that passive restriction of unplanned fires in extreme weather, by prescribed burning, is incompatible with floristic conservation objectives.},

  Abstract                 = {Populations of plants that rely on seeds for recovery from disturbance by fire (obligate seeders) are sensitive to regimes of frequent fire. Obligate seeders are prominent in fire-prone heathlands of southern Australia and South Africa. Population extinction may occur if there are successive fires during a plant's juvenile period. Research on the population biology of obligate seeders has influenced the management of fire in these heath and shrublands, but work on the effects of the spatial variability of fires is lacking. We hypothesize that extinction may be avoided under an adverse fire frequency if fires are patchy. We present a model that simulates the effects of spatial and temporal variations in fire regimes on the viability of a plant populations in a grid landscape. Seedling establishment, maturation, senescence, and seed dispersal determine the presence of absence of plants in each cell. We used values typical of serotinous Banksia species to estimate probability of extinction in relation to fire frequency, spatial burning pattern and size variance, and the size of the grid. Simulations 200 years in length indicated that extinction probability was lowest when fire frequency was intermediate and man fire size was large. When fire frequency was high, extinction probability was high irrespective of fire size. Senescence was more important than high-frequency fire as a cause of extinction in cells. Interactions between dispersal, fire frequency, and size were complex, indicating that extinction is governed by interactions between dispersal, fire frequency, and size were complex, indicating that extinction is governed by intercell connectivity. The model indicates that fire patchiness cannot be assumed to ensure avoidance of extinction of populations. Conservation of populations is most likely when fire patchiness is relatively low-when the size of fires is moderate to large and when burned patches are contiguous.}

Plant community composition and species frequency and density (of a subset of species) were compared among sites burnt by either one, two or three fires in the period 1988-1990 inclusive. Constrained ordination indicated that number of fires had a significant effect on floristic composition. Site variables also had a significant effect on floristics and frequency and accounted for a larger proportion of variation than did number of fires. Analyses of deviance indicated that frequency in 13 species was unaffected by fire regimes or site factors. Site factors significantly affected frequency in 42 species. Frequency in seven species was significantly affected by fire regimes (no site effect). In six of these, frequency was lower in areas subjected to either two or three fires compared to one fire. Three of these species were obligate seeders. Frequency in the other species (a herbaceous resprouter) was significantly higher in the area subjected to two fires. There was no significant effect of fire on species richness. Densities of seven out of a subset of eight species were also significantly affected by fire (two obligate seeder spp.) and site factors (four spp.), Significantly lower densities were related to multiple fires. The study indicated that regimes of frequent fire can deplete populations of some heathland species with the dominant shrub species, Banksia ericifolia L.f., being most affected.},

  Abstract                 = {Plant invasions are widely recognized as significant threats to biodiversity conservation worldwide. One way invasions can affect native ecosystems is by changing fuel properties, which can in turn affect fire behavior and, ultimately, alter fire regime characteristics such as frequency, intensity, extent, type, and seasonality of fire. If the regime changes subsequently promote the dominance of the invaders, then an invasive plant-fire regime cycle can be established. As more ecosystem components and interactions are altered, restoration of preinvasion conditions becomes more difficult. Restoration may require managing fuel conditions, fire regimes, native plant communities, and other ecosystem properties in addition to the invaders that caused the changes in the first place. We present a multiphase model describing the interrelationships between plant invaders and fire regimes, provide a system for evaluating the relative effects of invaders and prioritizing them for control, and recommend ways to restore preinvasion fire regime properties.},

  Abstract                 = {1 Although the season of fire occurrence is known to affect recruitment to plant populations, it has received little attention. This study investigated the dynamics of the canopy-stored seed banks of two Australian obligate seeder shrubs, Petrophile sessilis and Hakea sericea (Proteaceae), with the objective of determining the changes in viable seed supply over a year. 2 The total number of germinable seeds in the canopy, each month for 12 months during 1996-97, was estimated from separate measures of (i) pre-dispersal predation of fruits; (ii) seed predation of insect parasitoids; (iii) viability of intact seeds; and (iv) loss of seed viability following experimental heating. 3 The two species had very different seed bank dynamics throughout the year. The seed store of P. sessilis appeared to be being replaced annually, as seeds in the older fruits rapidly lost germinability and new fruits matured to replace them. For H. sericea, the seed store appeared to be accumulating each year, because older fruits retained a high level of germinability. 4 The study indicates that no one fire season will maximize the germinable seed release after fire for all species. Management strategies should therefore include varied seasons of prescribed burning to avoid compositional change and a decrease in diversity that may result from a single-season approach.},

Presettlement annual area burned for the entire SBW was 4,290 ha by stand replacement fire and 4,310 ha by nonlethal understory fire. All recent period fires>4 ha were mapped using a GIS system. Area burned was determined by the fire severity classes: crowning, lethal surface, nonlethal surface, and no burning. Annual area burned averaged 2,780 ha by stand replacement and 2,270 by understory fire. Area burned during presettlement was 1.7 times that during the recent period. During the presettlement period, area burned by stand replacement and nonlethal understory fire was 1.5 and 1.9 times greater respectively than during the recent period.},

  Abstract                 = {Proliferation of woody plants in grasslands and savannas since the 1800s has been widely documented. In the southwestern United States, increased abundance of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa var. glandulosa) has been attributed to heavy grazing by livestock. Here, we test the hypothesis that P. glandulosa invasion of grasslands requires, first, reductions in herbaceous biomass and density such as those that accompany livestock grazing and, second, episodes of high soil moisture availability. No combination of grass density (nonmanipulated or reduced 50%) or defoliation (none, moderate, heavy) significantly affected P. glandulosa seedling emergence within a watering regime (natural and supplemented) at our field site in semiarid southern Texas. Seedling emergence on plots receiving only natural rainfall was high (42%), despite the fact that precipitation was substantially below normal. Supplemental watering, to generate moisture levels approximating years of unusually high annual rainfall, increased emergence to 59%. Seedling survival after 2 yr was high (62-77%) and statistically comparable across the density, defoliation, and watering treatments. Net photosynthesis (A(n)) of 1-yr-old seedlings was enhanced by supplemental watering, but reductions in grass density or biomass had little effect on seedling A(n) or xylem water potential. Height, aboveground biomass, and leaf area were comparable among 1- and 2-yr-old seedings across all density, defoliation, and watering combinations. High seedling emergence and survival on unwatered plots, even during a ''drought year,'' suggests that Prosopis recruitment is not contingent upon unusual or episodic rainfall. Reductions in biomass and density of herbaceous vegetation had no influence on seedling emergence, growth, or survival, suggesting that Prosopis invasion is minimally influenced by grass competition. Historic grazing at this site appears to have altered herbaceous composition and reduced above- and belowground biomass production below the threshold level required for competitive exclusion of woody vegetation. Such data suggest that rates and patterns of seed dispersal may be the primary determinants of P. glandulosa encroachment on present-day landscapes in semiarid regions. Minimizing livestock dispersal of seed (in the case of leguminous shrubs) and maintenance of an effective fire regime (through production of fine fuels) may be crucial for sustaining herbaceous composition and production in grazed systems prone to invasion by unpalatable woody plants.},

  Abstract                 = {Historical variability in lire regimes and forest age structures is necessary reference information for management of vegetation and landscape patterns in naturally managed ecosystems. In this study, we reconstructed fire history and forest age structure at Point Reyes National Seashore on the central California coast to document changes in forest conditions over the past ca. two centuries. Surface fin history was reconstructed from dendrochronologically-crossdated fire scarred trees in two stands of Douglas-fir (\emph{Pseudotsuga menziesii var, menziesii}) and one stand of coast redwood (\emph{Sequoia sempervirens}). Age structure in an approximately 2000 ha area of Douglas-fir forest was examined for tree recruitment patterns. Reconstructed mean surface fire intervals and Weibull median probability intervals ranged from similar to 7 to similar to 13 years. Fires generally occurred late in the growing season or after growth had ceased for a year. Spatial patterns of historic fires and those reconstructed from the fire-scar record document often widespread fires in the central Olema Valley. Likely many, if not most, of the fires reconstructed from Point Reyes were ignited by humans given the long history of intensive use of this area, first by the Coast Miwok and later by European ranchers. Age structures of stands suggest that much of the Douglas-fir overstory is multiaged with little evidence of stand-replacing fin or other disturbance events. Ages of trees in Douglas-fir stands document increasing landscape coverage of Douglas-fir forest at Point Reyes and hardwood recruitment under older Douglas-fu canopies, and suggest that loss of surface fires is having cascading effects on landscape vegetation patterns, community relationships, and probably related ecosystem processes.}

A master chronology for the study area was first developed from old-growth trees and provided dating control for fire-scarred samples. Redwood offers a challenge for dendrochronology owing to partially absent rings (ring wedging) and uniform ring widths (complacency). Cross dating was successful in portions of 12 of 24 fire-scarred trees. Fire events were dated by noting the position of fire scars and other fire-associated ring structures (resin ducts, double latewood, growth releases, and ring separations) in the cross-dated ring series. Using only dates of fire scars, the mean fire interval (MFI) was 9.9 years from the first recorded fire in 1714 to the last in 1962. The MFI was 8.0 years for the best represented (greatest sample depth) presettlement period from 1714 to 1881. Using dates for all fire-associated ring features, the MFI from 1714 to 1962 was 7.0 years and from 1714 to 1881 was 6.0 years. Use of all fire-associated ring characteristics is argued to be a more complete representation of past fire frequency due to possible under-representation of fire-scar records from stump-top samples. Based upon scar positions within annual rings, fires occurred predominately late in the growing season or after growth ceased for the year. The mean fire intervals determined are shorter than those reported in all except one other fire history study from coast redwood and suggest that fire frequency in redwood may have been underestimated in many past studies.}

  Abstract                 = {Parameters of fire regimes, including fire frequency, spatial extent of burned areas, fire severity, and season of fire occurrence, influence vegetation patterns over multiple scales. In this study, centuries-long patterns of fire events in a montane ponderosa pine - Douglas-fir forest landscape surrounding Cheesman Lake in central Colorado were reconstructed from fire-scarred trees and inferences from forest stand ages. We crossdated 153 fire-scarred trees from an approximately 4000 ha study area that recorded 77 total fire years from 1197 to the present. Spatial extent of burned areas during fire years varied from the scale of single trees or small clusters of trees to fires that burned across the entire landscape. Intervals between fire years varied from 1 to 29 years across the entire landscape to 3 to 58 years in one stand, to over 100 years in other stands. Large portions of the landscape did not record any fire for a 128 year-long period from 1723 to 1851. Fire severity varied from low-intensity surface fires to large-scale, stand-destroying fires, especially during the 1851 fire year but also possibly during other years. Fires occurred throughout tree growing seasons and both before and after growing seasons. These results suggest that the fire regime has varied considerably across the study area during the past several centuries. Since fires influence plant establishment and mortality on the landscape, these results further suggest that vegetation patterns changed at multiple scales during this period. The fire history from Cheesman Lake documents a greater range in fire behavior in ponderosa pine forests than generally has been found in previous studies.},

  Abstract                 = {The idea that sex functions to provide variation for natural selection to act upon was first advocated by August Weismann and it has dominated much discussion on the evolution of sex and recombination since then. The goal of this paper is to further extend this hypothesis and to assess its place in a larger body of theory on the evolution of sex and recombination. A simple generic model is developed to show how fitness variation and covariation interact with selection for recombination and illustrate some important implications of the hypothesis: (1) the advantage of sex and recombination can accrue both to reproductively isolated populations and to modifiers segregating within populations, but the former will be much larger than the latter; (2) forces of degradation that are correlated across loci within an individual can reduce or reverse selection for increased recombination; and (3) crossing-over (which can occur at different places in different meioses) will create more variability than having multiple chromosomes and so will have more influence on the efficacy of selection. Several long-term selection experiments support Weismann's hypothesis, including those showing a greater response to selection in populations with higher rates of recombination and higher rates of recombination evolving as a correlated response to selection for some other character. Weismann's hypothesis is also consistent with the sporadic distribution of obligate asexuality, which indicates that clones have a higher rate of extinction than sexuals. Weismann's hypothesis is then discussed in light of other patterns in the distribution of sexuality versus asexuality. To account for variation in the frequency of obligate asexuality in different taxa, a simple model is developed in which this frequency is a function of three parameters: the rate of clonal origin, the initial fitness of clones when they arise, and the rate at which that fitness declines over time. Variation in all three parameters is likely to be important in explaining the distribution of obligate asexuality. Facultative asexuality also exists, and for this to be stable it seems there must br ecological differences between the sexual and as well as genetic differences. Finally, the timing of sex in cyclical parthenogens is most likely set to minimize the opportunity costs of sex. None of these patterns contradict Weismann's hypothesis, but they do show that many additional principles unrelated to the function of sex are required to fully explain its distribution. Weismann's hypothesis is also consistent with what we know about the mechanics and molecular genetics of recombination, in particular the tendency for chromatids to recombine with a homolog rather than a sister chromatid at meiosis, which is opposite to what they do during mitosis. However, molecular genetic studies have shown that cis-acting sites at which recombination is initiated are lost by gene conversion as a result, a factor that can be expected to affect many fine details in the evolution of recombination. In summary, although Weismann's hypothesis must be considered the leading candidate for the function of sex and recombination, nevertheless, many additional principles are needed to fully account for their evolution.},

No mortality was observed in either species. Individual plant size, measured as the individual stump area, was the most important factor determining both number and biomass of resprouts for all fire treatments. The number of resprouts at 3 months was less at the higher temperature, but no difference could not be detected at 18 months. Duration of flame application had no effect on resprouting success. This effect was not statistically significant 18 months after treatments were applied. Biomass of resprouts was not clearly affected by different fire treatments either 3 months or 18 months after the start of the resprouting process.},

  Abstract                 = {1. We investigated whether reserves stored in the lignotubers of two Mediterranean shrubs, Arbutus unedo and Erica arborea, were significantly mobilized to support the demands of regrowth and respiration after clipping the tops at different frequencies. 2. After a single clipping, Arbutus showed a 29% decrease of phosphorus concentration by the end of the first growing season. Two years after recovery from clipping, the starch levels remained lower than those of unclipped plants. Similarly, Erica showed depletion of starch, but no nutrient reserves were depleted significantly. 3. Regrowth after multiple clippings mobilized a large fraction of the starch and nutri ents stored in the lignotuber. Mean starch concentrations were depleted by 87-93% after multiple clippings and concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium were depleted by 10-45%, 27-41%, 19-39% and 23-31%, respectively. 4. An average-sized lignotuber produced 288 resprouts for Arbutus and 1990 resprouts for Erica during a 27 month period of multiple clippings, at the end of which the first plants died. 5. Plant mortality after multiple clipping was 10% for Arbutus and 30% for Erica, and was primarily attributed to exhaustion of carbon reserves because starch concentrations decreased by 96% in dead plants.},

  Abstract                 = {1 Both fire regimes and the conditions under which fires occur vary widely. Abiotic conditions (such as climate) in combination with fire season, frequency and intensity could influence vegetation responses to fire. A variety of adaptations facilitate post-fire recruitment in mediterranean climate ecosystems, but responses of other communities are less well known. We evaluated the importance of climate by comparing sites with mediterranean and subtropical climates. 2 We used paired burned and mature sites in chamise chaparral, mixed chaparral and coastal sage scrub (California), and rosemary scrub, sand pine scrub and sandhill (Florida), to test whether (i) patterns of pre-fire and post-fire seedling recruitment are more similar between communities within a region than between regions, and (ii) post-fire stimulation of seedling establishment is greater in regions with marked fire-induced contrasts in abiotic site characteristics. 3 Post-fire seedling densities were more similar among sites within climatic regions than between regions. Both seedling densities and proportions of species represented by seedlings after fires were generally higher in California. 4 The only site characteristic showing a pre-fire-post-fire contrast was percentage open canopy, and the effect was greater in California than in Florida. Soil properties were unaffected by fire. 5 Mediterranean climate ecosystems in other regions have nutrient-poor soils similar to our subtropical Florida sites, but show post-fire seedling recruitment patterns more similar to the nutrient-rich sites in California. Climate therefore appears to play a more major role than soil characteristics.},

The task is accomplished by means of a minimal model encapsulating a few assumptions on the interactions between overstory and understory species and on the mechanisms of fire development and transmission. The main difference with other models for fire prediction and simulation is that, here, fire is an endogenous variable with purely deterministic dynamics. Nevertheless, the analysis shows that fire recurrence can be chaotic for parameter values corresponding to Mediterranean forests. By contrast, the model shows that boreal forests and savannas have the tendency to experience periodic fires. These general results are in agreement with the studies carried out on many different forests in this century.},

  Abstract                 = {Darwin viewed species range limits as chiefly determined by an interplay between the abiotic environment and interspecific interactions. Haldane argued that species' ranges could be set intraspecifically when gene flow from a species' populous center overwhelms local adaptation at the periphery. Recently, Kirkpatrick and Barton have modeled Haldane's process with a quantitative genetic model that combines density-dependent local population growth with dispersal and gene flow across a linear environmental gradient in optimum phenotype. To address Darwin's ideas, we have extended the Kirkpatrick and Barton model to include interspecific competition and the frequency-dependent selection that it generates, as well as stabilizing selection on a quantitative character. Our model includes local population growth, movements over space, natural selection, and gene now. It simultaneously addresses the evolution of character displacement and species borders. It reproduces the Kirkpatrick and Barton single-species result that limited ranges can be produced with sufficiently steep environmental gradients and strong dispersal. Further, in the absence of environmental gradients or barriers to dispersal, interspecific competition will not limit species ranges at evolutionary equilibrium. However, interspecific competition can interact with environmental gradients and gene flow to generate limited ranges with much less extreme gradient and dispersal parameters than in the single-species case. Species display character displacement in sympatry, yet the reduction in competition that results from this displacement does nor necessarily allow the two species to become sympatric everywhere. When species meet, competition reduces population densities in the region of overlap, which, in turn, intensifies the asymmetry in gene flow from center to margin. This reduces the ability of each species to adapt to local physical conditions at their range limits. If environmental gradients are monotonic but not linear, the transition zone between species at coevolutionary equilibrium occurs where the environmental gradient is steepest. If productivity gradients are also introduced into the model, then patterns similar to Rapoport's rule emerge. Interacting species respond to climate change, as it affects the optimal phenotype over space, by a combination of range shifts and local evolution in mean phenotype, while solitary species respond solely by range shifts. Finally, we compare empirical estimates for intrinsic growth rates and diffusion coefficients for several species to those needed by the single-species model to produce a stable limited range. These empirical values are generally insufficient to produce limited ranges in the model suggesting a role for interspecific interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {In the phytogeographic area known as Chaco Occidental (Argentina), agroforestry systems applying different ways of management are under evaluation. To increase the capacity of art area to support more animals per unit area, shrubs are removed by clearcutting at ground level. Among these shrubs are atamisqui (Capparis atamisquea O. Ktze., Capparidaceae), jarilla (Larrea divaricata Cav., Zygophyllaceae), and teatin (Acacia furcatispina Burk., Leguminosae). These shrubs are remarkable because they have high density, frequency and coverage, high resprouting capability and fast biomass recovery. However, there is very little information about them. The evaluation of the carbohydrate dynamics in native shrubs of the Chaco Occidental region has not been studied yet. Knowledge of seasonal variation of root carbohydrates in these species may be an important aspect to consider in the timing of clearcutting practice. In this study, three individuals of each species were sampled monthly, and starch and soluble sugars were determined. Starch plus soluble sugar comprise the total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) fraction. Results showed that the minimal TNC was observed during flowering for atamisqui and teatin, and during fruiting for jarilla, which coincided with the high rainfall of the early Summer. There were significant (P<0.01) differences in the TNC levels between dry- and wet season-atamisqui (257 and 183 mu g/mg dry weight), jarilla (196 and 135) and teatin (303 and 231), respectively. Therefore, the time of low TNC and consequently the best time to cut occurs during the time of highest precipitation, when plants have exhausted carbohydrate reserves from their roots to resprout and flower.},

At the same time, species that are too similar are unlikely to co‐occur because of competitive exclusion. In an effort to explain the coexistence of 17 oak species within forest communities in North Central Florida, we examined correlations between the phylogenetic relatedness of oak species, their degree of co‐occurrence within communities and niche overlap across environmental gradients, and their similarity in ecophysiological and life‐history traits. We show that the oaks are phylogenetically overdispersed because co‐occurring species are more distantly related than expected by chance, and oaks within the same clade show less niche overlap than expected. Hence, communities are more likely to include members of both the red oak and the oak clades than only members of one clade. This pattern of phylogenetic overdispersion arises because traits important for habitat specialization show evolutionary convergence. We hypothesize further that certain conserved traits permit coexistence of distantly related congeners. These results provide an explanation for how oak diversity is maintained at the community level in North Central Florida.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigated the hydraulic properties in relation to soil moisture, leaf habit, and phylogenetic lineage of 17 species of oaks (Quercus) that occur sympatrically in northern central Florida (USA). Leaf area per shoot increased and Huber values (ratio of sapwood area to leaf area) decreased with increasing soil moisture of species’ habitats. As a result, maximum hydraulic conductance and maximum transpiration were positively correlated with mean soil moisture when calculated on a sapwood area basis, but not when calculated on a leaf area basis. This reveals the important role that changes in allometry among closely related species can play in co-ordinating water transport capacity with soil water availability. There were significant differences in specific conductivity between species, but these differences were not explained by leaf habit or by evolutionary lineage. However, white oaks had significantly smaller average vessel diameters than red oaks or live oaks. Due to their lower Huber values, maximum leaf specific conductivity (KL) was higher in evergreen species than in deciduous species and higher in live oaks than in red oaks or white oaks. There were large differences between species and between evolutionary lineages in freeze–thaw-induced embolism. Deciduous species, on average, showed greater vulnerability to freezing than evergreen species. This result is strongly influenced by evolutionary lineage. Specifically, white oaks, which are all deciduous, had significantly higher vulnerability to freezing than live oaks (all evergreen) and red oaks, which include both evergreen and deciduous species. These results highlight the importance of taking evolutionary lineage into account in comparative physiological studies.},

The models assume that the trait is controlled by many additive genes. A nor-optimal selection function is used, in which the optimum either moves steadily in one direction, follows an autocorrelated linear Markov process or a random walk, or varies cyclically. The consequences for population mean fitness of a reduction in genetic variance, due to a shift from sexual to asexual reproduction are examined. It is shown that a large reduction in mean fitness can result from such a shift in the case of a steadily moving optimum, under light conditions. The conditions are much more stringent with a cyclical or randomly varying environment, especially if the autocorrelation for a random environment is small. The conditions for spread of a rare modifier affecting the rate of genetic recombination are also examined, and the strength of selection on such a modifier determined. Again, the case of a steadily moving optimum is most favourable for the evolution of increased recombination. The selection pressure on a recombination modifier when a trait is subject to strong truncation selection is calculated, and shown to be large enough to account for observed increases in recombination associated with artificial selection. Theoretical and empirical evidence relevant to evaluating the importance of this model for the evolution of sex and recombination is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {I review the mathematical and biological aspects of Hubbell's (2001) neutral theory of species abundance for ecological communities, and clarify its historical connections with closely related approaches in population genetics. A selective overview of the empirical evidence for and against this theory is provided, with a special emphasis on tropical plant communities. The neutral theory predicts many of the basic patterns of biodiversity, confirming its heuristic power. The strict assumption of equivalence that defines neutrality, equivalence among individuals, finds little empirical support in general. However, a weaker assumption holds for stable communities, the equivalence of average fitness among species. One reason for the surprising success of the neutral theory is that all the theories of species coexistence satisfying the fitness equivalence assumption, including many theories of niche differentiation, generate exactly the same patterns as the neutral theory. Hubbell's neutral theory represents an important synthesis and a much needed demonstration of the pivotal role of intraspecific variability in ecology. Further improvements should lead to an explicit linking to niche-based processes. This research programme will depend crucially on forthcoming theoretical and empirical achievements.},

This simulator makes it possible to investigate impacts on the spatial distribution and the extinction probability of plant species. I present the results of a two-species competition scenario. Coexistence is found to be possible for competitively dissimilar species, and the criterion for this coexistence is given analytically in the reaction-diffusion approximation. A higher frequency of tree falls implies a smaller extinction probability of least adapted species. The multispecies model is also investigated. A mathematical quantity-the persistence function-permits measurement of the ability of a species to out compete other species locally. This quantity is compared with the average time to extinction, and it is computed for the TROLL simulator. I interpret the shape of this function in light of available information on the persistence function in simple interacting particle systems. These results indicate an analogy between the dynamics of forest communities and a simple discrete and spatially explicit model, the voter model. The ecological implications of this analogy are discussed and are extended to species-rich communities.},

While each of these processes, and more, have been shown to act in particular communities, much remains to be learned about their relative importance in shaping community-level patterns. We used a spatially-explicit, individual-based model to assess the effects of each of these processes on species richness, relative abundance, and spatial patterns such as the species-area curve. Our model communities had an order-of-magnitude more individuals than any previous such study, and we also developed a finite-size scaling analysis to infer the large-scale properties of these systems in order to establish the generality of our conclusions across system sizes. As expected, each mechanism can promote diversity. We found some qualitative differences in community patterns across communities in which different combinations of these mechanisms operate. Species-area curves follow a power law with short-range dispersal and a logarithmic law with global dispersal. Relative-abundance distributions are more even for systems with competitive differences and trade-offs than for those in which all species are competitively equivalent, and they are most even when frequency dependence (even if weak) is present. Overall, however, communities in which different processes operated showed surprisingly similar patterns, which suggests that the form of community-level patterns cannot in general be used to distinguish among mechanisms maintaining diversity there. Nevertheless, parameterization of models such as these from field data on the strengths of the different mechanisms could yield insight into their relative roles in diversity maintenance in any given community.},

Animal dispersal and insect pollination predominate across all. forest types and size classes. In second-growth trees, relative abundance of species with explosive dispersal, hermaphroditic flowers, and insect pollination is higher, and relative abundance of species with animal dispersal and mammal pollination is lower, compared to old-growth and logged forests. Overall, dioecy and wind dispersal are more frequent than expected in canopy trees, and hermaphroditic flowers are more frequent than expected in shrubs. Reproductive traits, growth-form traits, and relative abundance patterns show significant clustering within the supertree phylogeny. Patterns of trait distribution across forest types are closely linked with patterns of floristic composition at the genus and family level. Species-level associations among reproductive traits and woody growth form can be explained by phylogenetic correlations. Wind dispersal and hummingbird pollination are significantly concentrated in clades with hermaphroditic flowers, whereas wind pollination is concentrated in clades with unisexual flowers. Legacies of both phylogenetic history and forest disturbance structure the distribution of reproductive traits within and among tropical wet forest communities.},

France), and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.) seedlings to a wide range of light availability in natural environments in interior British Columbia over three growing seasons. With decreasing light availability, (1) survival in Pseudotsuga menziesii and Picea engelmannii did not change whereas it significantly decreased in Pinus ponderosa, (2) Picea engelmannii had the greatest decrease in height growth, Pseudotsuga menziesii had the greatest decrease in diameter growth, and there were no significant differences in the decrease of absolute and relative biomass growth among the species, and (3) Pseudotsuga menziesii and Picea engelmannii were plastic in the absolute above-to below-ground biomass growth ratio, height/diameter ratio, and specific leaf area whereas these ratios did not change in Pinus ponderosa. These findings suggest that (i) survival is an important measure of shade tolerance, (ii) without taking into account survival, different growth measures may lead to different rankings of shade tolerance, and (iii) selected measures of morphological characteristics are more plastic in more shade-tolerant than less shade-intolerant species.},

  Abstract                 = {The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable, Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays over time, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coexistence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover.},

  Abstract                 = {A model of disturbance effects on fire-dependent tree populations is developed, parameterized, and tested using long-term data from northwestern Minnesota to determine the extent to which disturbance controls species composition. The model assumes fires ate necessary for recruitment, and they may cause mortality, depending on species, Reproductive success is estimated as an integral equation (analogous to Lotka's equation for R(0)) taking into account fecundity schedules, mortality schedules, and age-specific disturbance effects, Life histories are parameterized for the three dominant fire-dependent tree taxa in the region, Pinus resinosa, Betula papyrifera, and Populus. Long-term disturbance regimes are summarized as density functions of intervals between fires parameterized from fire scars on trees and in sediment charcoal records. Changes in the density of fire intervals in the past are the basis for predictions that different taxa would dominate, depending on their life histories, Fossil pollen data indicate changing abundances of tree taxa and are used to test predictions of the model of reproductive success. Comparisons of model predictions with changing abundances of pollen indicate that the density of fire regimes is one of the important controls on composition. Pinus resinosa is limited by the high frequency of fire, but longevity is an advantage in the region for this species; Betula is limited by frequent fire, and longevity is of little advantage; and Populus is least sensitive to fire regime. Results show that knowing simply the frequency of fire can lead to naive interpretations of fire effects (or lack thereof). The higher moments of disturbance densities can be critical for understanding responses of species that require extended intervals to achieve resistance to fire. These extended intervals may be race, in which case they are better described by the higher moments of the density than they are by the mean interval.}

  Abstract                 = {Rock outcrops are landscape features that may form habitat islands in a matrix of more widespread vegetation. The patterns of floristics, reproduction, gender, life span, growth forms, and fire response traits were compared between rock outcrops and matrix sclerophyll vegetation to test for insularity in taxon composition and functional traits. The outcrops and matrix had similar reproduction, gender, life span, and growth form traits, being dominated by co-sexual sclerophyll shrubs. The outcrops, however, were dissimilar in species composition and functional traits forming an archipelago of habitat islands in a forest matrix. Rank abundance curves were less even on rock outcrops than in adjacent forests, being dominated by shrubs that were killed by fire (obligate seeders). The ratio of shrubs killed by fire (obligate seeders) to resprouters was 70:30 on the outcrops compared with 38:62 in the matrix. Evidence for functional convergence in fire response traits comes from 27 genera, in 17 families, which have congeners in each habitat. Most shrub congeners on or near rocky outcrops were killed by fire whereas related taxa in the forests resprout after fire. Functional convergence can be related to disturbance frequency and/or differences in regeneration niche among habitats. A resprouting response appears to be related to more frequent fires in the matrix as outcrops experience fires less often. The dominance of obligate seeding shrubs on high rainfall outcrops may also be related to better resources in an environment where allocation to growth rather than storage could be advantageous. In drier and shadier habitats, however, resprouting may be promoted over seedling recruitment as the risks of recruitment failure are higher.},

  Abstract                 = {Aim Landscape features, such as rock outcrops and ravines, can act as habitat islands in fire-prone vegetation by influencing the fire regime. In coastal and sub-coastal areas of Australia, rock outcrops and pavements form potential habitat islands in a matrix of fire-prone eucalypt forests. The aim of this study was to compare floristic composition and fire response traits of plants occurring on rocky areas and contrast them with the surrounding matrix. Methods Patterns of plant community composition and fire response were compared between rocky areas and surrounding sclerophyll forests in a range of climate types to test for differences. Classification and ordination were used to compare floristic composition and univariate analyses were used to compare fire response traits. Results The rock outcrops and pavements were dissimilar in species composition from the forest matrix but shared genera and families with the matrix. Outcrops and pavements were dominated by scleromorphic shrubs that were mainly killed by fire and had post-fire seedling recruitment (obligate seeders). In contrast, the most abundant species in the adjacent forest matrix were species that sprout after fire (sprouters). Main conclusions Fire frequency and intensity are likely to be less on outcrops than in the forest matrix because the physical barrier of rock edges disrupts fires. Under the regime of more frequent fires, obligate seeders have been removed or reduced in abundance from the forest matrix. This process may have also operated over evolutionary time-scales and resulted in convergence towards obligate seeding traits on outcrop fire shadows. In contrast, there may have been convergence towards sprouting in the forest matrix as a result of selection for persistence under a regime of frequent fire.},

  Abstract                 = {1 The relationship between environment and the ability of plant species to resprout has been explored more in terms of disturbance frequency than of resource gradients, and has rarely been examined in non-Mediterranean landscapes. 2 The fire response of 296 non-eucalypt woody taxa was recorded in five habitats in the New England Tablelands (NET) Bioregion of eastern Australia: grassy woodlands, dry sclerophyll forests, rocky outcrops, wet heaths and wet sclerophyll forests. We then tested whether there was a dichotomy of response to crown fire, whether the proportion of resprouters differed among habitats, and if disturbance frequency or resource-productivity models could account for landscape patterns of resprouting. 3 There was a continuum of sprouting ability but most species could be classified as obligate seeders (killed by fire) or resprouters. Habitats differed in the proportion of resprouting species, with rocky outcrops having the lowest proportion and grassy forests and wet heaths the highest. This pattern was consistent at the congeneric and confamilar phylogenetic levels of comparison. 4 Resource/productivity models better explained landscape patterns of resprouting than disturbance frequency models. There was a strong positive relationship between resprouting and increasing soil fertility and moisture gradients. Species richness and obligate seeder richness increased with climate variability and landscape heterogeneity. 5 Landscape resprouting patterns were explained by a resource-competition model where resprouters are favoured because of their ability to persist in more competitive environments. Overall, we suggest that disturbance frequency has larger effects on species richness at the low end of the productivity gradient than at the high end.},

  Abstract                 = {Besides woody cone scales, certain species of wind-dispersed pines (Pinus) have spines on their scales as a putative form of defense against seed predators. We tested whether spines differentially deterred seed predators foraging on closed and open pine cones. Red Crossbills (Loxia curvirostra) were selected as the seed predator because they commonly forage on these cones. We timed crossbills foraging on closed and open pine cones with and without spines. Crossbills did not require more time to remove seeds from closed ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa) cones with spines. However, crossbills required significantly more time (18-34%) to remove seeds from open ponderosa pine and Table Mountain pine (P. pungens) cones with spines than from cones whose spines had been removed. Moreover, experiments designed to isolate the effect of spines on the perching and probing behavior of crossbills revealed that spines hindered both activities additively. These experimental results were consistent with our phylogenetic analyses of 21 species of hard pines (subgenus Pinus). Whereas the evolution of changes in the length of time seeds are retained in closed cones and that of changes in the presence of spines appear independent, changes in the length of time seeds are retained in open cones were associated with changes in the presence or development of spines. Therefore, pines that retain seeds in open but not closed cones for extended periods tend to have well-developed spines. This illustrates the complementarity of experimental approaches and explicit phylogenetic models in elucidating ecological processes.},

  Abstract                 = {Paleoenvironments of the Torrey Pines State Reserve were reconstructed from a 3600-yr core from Los Penasquitos Lagoon using fossil pollen, spores, charcoal, chemical stratigraphy, particle size, and magnetic susceptibility. Late Holocene sediments were radiocarbon dated, while the historical sediments were dated using sediment chemistry, fossil pollen, and historical records. At 3600 yr B.P., the estuary was a brackish-water lagoon. By 2800 yr B.P,, Poaceae (grass) pollen increased to high levels, suggesting that the rising level of the core site led to its colonization by Spartina foliosa (cord-grass), the lowest-elevation plant type within regional estuaries. An increase in pollen and spores of moisture-dependent species suggests a climate with more available moisture after 2600 yr B.P. This change is similar to that found 280 km to the north at 3250 yr B.P., implying that regional climate changes were time-transgressive from north to south. Increased postsettlement sediment input resulted from nineteenth-century land disturbances caused by grazing and fire. Sedimentation rates increased further in the twentieth century due to closure of the estuarine mouth. The endemic Pinus torreyana (Torrey pine) was present at the site throughout this 3600-yr interval but was less numerous prior to 2100 yr B.P. This history may have contributed to the low genetic diversity of this species. (C) 2000 University of Washington.},

  Abstract                 = {Ecological communities are spatially and temporally variable in response to a variety of biotic and abiotic forces. It is not always cleat, however, if spatial and temporal variability leads to instability in communities. Instability may result from strong biotic interactions or from stochastic processes acting on small populations. I used 10-15 yr of annual data from the Konza Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research site to examine whether plant, breeding bird, grasshopper, and small mammal communities in tallgrass prairie exhibit stability or directional change in response to different experimentally induced fire frequencies. Based on ordination and ANOVA, plant and grasshopper communities on annually burned sites differed significantly from plant and grasshopper communities on less frequently burned sites. Breeding birds and small mammals differed among sites as well, but these differences were not clearly related to disturbance frequency A modified time series analysis indicated that plant communities were undergoing directional change (unstable) on all watersheds, regardless of fire frequency. Contrary to expectations, directional change was greatest on the annually burned sites and lowest on the infrequently burned sites. Unlike the plant communities, breeding bird. grasshopper, and small mammal communities were temporally stable, despite high-compositional variability from 1 yr to the next. Stability among the consumer communities within these dynamic plant communities occurs because three-dimensional vegetation structure does not change over time, despite changes in plant species composition. Evidence suggests that instability in the plant community results from strong biotic interactions among temporally persistent core species and stochastic dynamics among infrequent satellite species. Overall, community stability cannot be assessed if the pattern of temporal dynamics is unknown. Long-term empirical studies of different taxa under different disturbance regimes are needed to determine over what time frames and spatial scales communities may be stable. Such studies are essential for the development of generalities regarding the relationship between disturbance frequency and community stability in terrestrial and aquatic systems.},

If such decline is to be halted ecological mechanisms that restore or maintain biodiversity are needed. Two long-term field experiments were performed in native grassland to assess the effects of fire, nitrogen addition, and grazing or mowing on plant species diversity. In one experiment, richness declined on burned and fertilized treatments, whereas mowing maintained diversity under these conditions. In the second experiment, loss of species diversity due to frequent burning was reversed by bison, a keystone herbivore in North American grasslands. Thus, mowing or the reestablishment of grazing in anthropogenically stressed grasslands enhanced biodiversity.},

  Abstract                 = {Fire behaviour is strongly influenced by fuel load and structure; however, efforts to describe fuel patterns have largely ignored differences among species or post-fire regeneration strategies. In California chaparral, evergreen shrubs can be grouped into three post-fire regeneration strategies that correlate with a wide variety of physiological and demographic characteristics including seasonal water status and the timing of reproduction in response to fire. To test if regeneration strategy is also associated with flammability, we compared the fuel loads and structure of two post-fire seeders, Adenostoma fasciculatum and Ceanothus cuneatus, and two obligate resprouters, Heteromeles arbutifolia and Prunus ilicifolia. Species and post-fire regeneration strategies did not differ in total fuel per area, or bulk density. The proportion of fuels smaller than 6 mm in diameter differed among species, but not consistently with regeneration strategy. However, species with a post-fire seeding regeneration strategy had higher proportions of dead branches. We discuss how this difference could have arisen from evolutionary, demographic, or physiological processes.},

  Abstract                 = {A comparison of the species-area relations of south-western Cape limestone Fynbos islands (surrounded by Fynbos on acid sand) and equivalent-sized areas of mainland indicated a weak fragmentation effect on overall species richness. There was no difference between mainland and island floras in the frequency of species belonging to different dispersal types, pollination syndromes, growth forms and shrub height categories. This probably results from islands being exposed to the same disturbance (fire) regime and being accessible to similar pollination and dispersal vectors as the mainland. A fragmentation effect was also diluted by the establishment on islands of edaphic generalists from the adjacent acid sand Fynbos. Species most vulnerable to extinction on small limestone fragments were locally endemic and limestone-specialist shrubs. Our results suggest that the minimum reserve size needed to avoid species losses (including local endemics) is about 4-15 ha. This is encouraging since c. 90% of existing reserves in the transformed lowland Fynbos landscapes of the south-western Cape are larger than 15 ha. The results of empirically based studies such as this are likely to be locality-specific. Nonetheless, they do provide meaningful guidelines for reserve design and improve our understanding of fragmentation-related extinction patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {Cape fynbos communities are species-rich but apparently include many species with similar growth forms. Many of these species may be functional analogues with similar pathways for nutrient and water cycling, and carbon flux. This apparent functional redundancy suggests that the extinction of some analogues should have little impact on ecosystem-level processes. Much of the biological diversity in fynbos is associated with postfire regeneration traits which facilitate competition for space. Lottery and regeneration niche models can explain the coexistence of functionally analagous proteoid and ericoid shrubs. The diversity of regeneration traits within functional types provides a 'backup' in the event of fire-related stochastic population fluctuations. This ensures long-term stability of community structure, possibly maintaining functional diversity and ecosystem processes. Research to test hypotheses on the relationships between species diversify and ecosystem processes in fynbos communities may lack a tractable protocol; some directions are, however, given.},

  Abstract                 = {Trade-offs between allocation to sexual or vegetative regeneration capacity are well established as a driving force in the life history patterns of plants in fire-prone environments. However, it is not known whether such trade-offs exist in plants which after aboveground removing disturbances, such as fire, may regenerate by sexual (seeding) or asexual (sprouting) mechanisms. We evaluated whether in the fire-recruiting resprouter Erica australis, which after fire can regenerate by seedling establishment or resprouting, a larger investment in flowers and seeds prior to being disturbed by clipping its aboveground parts would decrease subsequent sprouting, that is, its vegetative regeneration capacity. We analysed the relationships between flower and seed production and the ensuing production and growth of sprouts of six plants from thirteen different sites in central-western Spain. We found no significant relationships between measures of sexual reproductive effort and resprout production and growth 6 months after clipping the aboveground parts of the plants. No evidence of trade-offs between sexual and asexual efforts was found. Furthermore, no significant relationship was found between lignotuber total non-structural carbohydrates and sexual reproductive effort. In addition, 2 years after the disturbance, resprout biomass was positively and significantly correlated with sexual reproductive effort prior to the disturbance. This indicates that growth of resprouts was higher at the sites where plants made a greater reproductive effort. The sites that were more favourable to producing flowers and seeds could also be more favourable to resprouting. (C) 2001 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.},

Despite its popularity, the assumptions and uncertainties of reconstructing the ancestral states of a single character have received less attention than the much less challenging endeavor of reconstructing; phylogenetic trees from many characters. Recent research suggests that parsimony reconstructions are often sensitive to violations of the almost universal assumption of equal probabilities of gains and losses. In addition, maximum likelihood has been developed as an alternative to parsimony reconstruction, and has also revealed a surprising amount of uncertainty in ancestral reconstructions.},

To understand the reaction of a relatively immobile guild of species to a wildfire, we pit-trapped lizards from 1996 to 1999 in both burned and unburned interior chaparral and Madrean evergreen forest. In 26,214 trap nights, we found relative abundance was up to 10 times greater in burned than unburned vegetation. Species richness and diversity values were also greater in burned sites. Our data indicate a rapid settlement of burned areas primarily by individuals that survived the fire. Increased capture rate, diversity and richness values in 1998 and 1999 indicate that many species of lizards may even prefer early successional stages in chaparral and Madrean evergreen forests. Resident species of Teiidae and Sceloporus undulatus were more adapted to disturbed habitats than other resident Phrynosomatidae or Crotophytidae.},

  Abstract                 = {Biological invasions are a global phenomenon that can accelerate disturbance regimes and facilitate colonization by other normative species. In a coastal grassland in northern California, we conducted a four-year exclosure experiment to assess the effects of soil disturbances by feral pigs (Sus scrofa) on plant community composition and soil nitrogen availability. Our results indicate that pig disturbances had substantial effects on the community, although many responses varied with plant functional group, geographic origin (native vs. exotic), and grassland type. ("Short patches" were dominated by annual grasses and forbs, whereas "tall patches" were dominated by perennial bunchgrasses.) Soil disturbances by pigs increased the richness of exotic plant species by 29% and native taxa by 24%. Although native perennial grasses were unaffected, disturbances reduced the biomass of exotic perennial grasses by 52% in tall patches and had no effect in short patches. Pig disturbances led to a 69% decrease in biomass of exotic annual grasses in tall patches but caused a 62% increase in short patches. Native, nongrass monocots exhibited the opposite biomass pattern as those seen for exotic annual grasses, with disturbance causing an 80% increase in tall patches and a 56% decrease in short patches. Native forbs were unaffected by disturbance, whereas the biomass of exotic forbs increased by 79% with disturbance in tall patches and showed no response in short patches. In contrast to these vegetation results, we found no evidence that pig disturbances affected nitrogen mineralization rates or soil moisture availability. Thus, we hypothesize that the observed vegetation changes were due to space clearing by pigs that provided greater opportunities for colonization and reduced intensity of competition, rather than changes in soil characteristics. In summary, although responses were variable, disturbances by feral pigs generally promoted the continued invasion of this coastal grassland by exotic plant taxa.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the recognized importance of fire in North American boreal forests, the relative importance of stochastic and determinist portions of intra-regional spatial variability in fire frequency is still poorly understood. The first objective of this study is to identify sources of spatial variability in fire frequency in a landscape of eastern Quebec's coniferous boreal forest. Broad-scale environmental factors considered included latitude, longitude, human activities and belonging to a given bioclimatic domain, whereas fine-scale factors included slope, position on the slope, aspect, elevation, surficial deposit and drainage. The average distance to waterbodies was also considered as a potential intermediate-scale source of variability in fire frequency. In order to assess these environmental factors' potential influence, they were incorporated into a proportional hazard model, a semi-parametric form of survival analysis. We also used a digital elevation model in order to evaluate the dominant aspect within neighborhoods of varying sizes and successively incorporated these covariates into the proportional hazard model. We found that longitude significantly affects fire frequency, suggesting a maritime influence on fire frequency in this coastal landscape. We also found that position on the slope was related to fire frequency since hilltops and upperslopes were subject to a lower fire frequency. Dominant aspect was also related to fire frequency, but only when characterized within a neighborhood delimited by 4,000 to 10,000-m radii (5,027-31,416 ha). A 2-6-fold variation in fire frequency can be induced by geographic and topographic contexts, suggesting a substantial intra-regional heterogeneity in disturbance regime with potential consequences on forest dynamics and biodiversity patterns. Implications for forest management are also briefly discussed.},

The early-Holocene pollen assemblage is dominated by Cupressaceae (>40%), Pinus (>20%), Quercus (5-20%), Artemisia (>15%), and Sarcobatus (>5%), suggesting pinyon-juniper-oak woodland in the uplands, with greasewood on the saltflats near the lake. Giant sequoia was widespread along the Sierra Nevada streams draining into Tulare Lake, prior to 9000 yr B.P. as Sequoiadendron pollen is greater than 4%. The pollen assemblages before 18,500 yr B.P. are similar to those of the early Holocene (Cupressaceae, Artemisia, and Sarcobatus), but a gap in sedimentation from ca. 18,500-10,500 yr B.P. prohibits characterization of full-glacial vegetation. The end of Great Basin-like pollen assemblages 7000 yr B.P. (demise of Sarcobatus) coincides with increased frequency of charcoal; i.e., greater fire frequency in the Holocene woodland and grassland. From 7000-4000 yr B.P. the pollen assemblage is dominated by Other Compositae and Chenopodiaceae-Amaranthus pollen, suggesting expansion of xerophytic steppe at the expense of oak woodland. Higher percentages of littoral pollen (Cyperaceae, Typha-Sparganium) and lower percentages of pelagic algae (Botryococcus + Pediastrum) during the middle Holocene indicate lake levels generally lower than during the early Holocene. The late Holocene begins with a cold-wet period 3500-2500 yr B.P. followed by progressive drying of the lake. Climate estimates based on modern pollen analogs confirm the climate implications of the vegetation and lake history. Early Holocene climate was cold and wet, and maximum Holocene temperature and drought occurred between 7000 and 4000 yr B.P. Cool-moist climate from 4000 to 2000 yr B.P. is followed by a return to aridity and high temperature ca. 1000 yr B.P. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V, All rights reserved.},

The ﬂaw in this approach is that distributions of species also reﬂect the inﬂuence of interactions with other species, so predictions based on climate envelopes may be very misleading if the interactions between species are altered by climate change. An additional problem is that current distributions may be the result of sources and sinks, in which species appear to thrive in places where they really persist only because individuals disperse into them from elsewhere. Here we use microcosm experiments on simple but realistic assemblages to show how misleading the climate envelope approach can be. We show that dispersal and interactions, which are important elements of population dynamics, must be included in predictions of biotic responses to climate change.},

  Abstract                 = {Progressive diebacks of outer canopy branchlets of Ceanothus crassifolius were repeatedly observed after rainless periods up to 9 mo in duration in the Santa Monica Mountains of southern California. Mean xylem pressures of branchlets near the end of drought were as low as -11.2 MPa (N = 22) with a mean of about 60 dead branchlets per shrub. Inoculation (N = 15) with three species of fungi previously isolated from the same population of C. crassifolius did not promote dieback, suggesting that the observed decline was not fungal induced, as had been proposed. Further, at least 50% of healthy-appearing twigs, without symptoms of dieback, contained isolatible endophytic fungi. We used a centrifugal force method to determine the range of xylem pressure causing cavitation (vulnerability curves) for branchlets (N = 12) and roots (N = 16). We combined vulnerability curves with soil texture data (N = 6) into a water transport model that estimated the critical values (P-Lerit) of leaf xylem pressure associated with the loss of water from soil to foliage. Maximum P-Lerit was between -10 and -11 MPa and within the range of minimum measured xylem pressures of branchlets during drought and dieback. Branchlet dieback correlated with seasonal declines in xylem pressure in concert with declining safety margins from hydraulic failure. Symptoms of dieback were duplicated in the field by partially severing stem xylem that normally supplied branchlets with water. Taken together, these results indicate that loss of hydraulic conductance to foliage was the probable cause of the observed dieback in C. crassifolius. Partial dieback of peripheral branchlets, and its attendant reduction in evaporative surface area, may be a last-resort mechanism for whole-plant water conservation and drought survival in this species.},

  Abstract                 = {Chaparral shrub communities of California are often dominated by indigenous species of the genus Ceanorthus, which is further divided into two subgenera: Cerastes and Ceanothus. Cerastes is comprised of species that are non-sprouters after fire and which have leaf morphological features suggesting strong tolerance to drought. In contrast, species in subgenus Ceanothus generally sprout after fire and have less xeromorphic leaves. We examined three pairs of Cerastes/Ceanothus species that commonly grow together in the Transverse Mountain Ranges of southern California (e.g., Santa Monica Mountains and San Gabriel Mountains). Each species Fair was sequentially replaced along an elevational gradient, with C. megacarpus/C. spinosus occurring at a low elevation, coastal rite; C. cuneatus/C. oliganthus at a site intermediate in elevation and distance from the ocean, and C, crassifolius/C. leucodermis st a high elevation, inland site. In general, the length of the summer drought period decreases and the amount of rainfall increases with increasing elevation and distance from the ocean In all pairwise comparisons, the non-sprouters in subgenus Cerastes (C. megacarpus; C. cuneatus; C. crassifolius) Here found to be more resistant to xylem embolism caused by water stress than species in subgenus Ceanothus (C. spinosus; C. oliganthus: C. leucodermis). The level of water stress causing 50% loss in hydraulic conductivity due to gas embolism varied between -7.1 to -10.8 MPa for subgenus Cerastes but -4.6 to -7.3 MPa for subgenus Ceanothus. As species pairs were sequentially replaced from low elevation to higher elevation, susceptibility to embolism also progressively increased. These results are consistent with the xeromorphic differences between subgenera and geographic distribution of the species.},

  Abstract                 = {Fire and erosion are two major disturbances affecting Mediterranean ecosystems. Both of them are closely related to climate. There is evidence of decreasing precipitation in the Mediterranean, particularly during summer. There are also indications of an increased variability in the rainfall distribution. Climatic changes, though show high heterogeneity at a local scale. Based on these observations, we have evaluated the following hypotheses for the Region of Valencia (East Spain). (1) During the past three decades, climatic conditions have become more favourable for wildfires and high erosivity rainfall events. We have used 30-year climate records from 97 meteorological stations to examine this. Results indicate that in general the hypothesis is true, although trends are spatially dependent. (2) The effect of high intensity rain on burned land may substantially affect short-term ecosystem composition and function, and thus successional trajectories. Based on a plot scale study, we have assessed nutrient and vegetation dynamics after burning a pyrophytic community dominated by gorse (Ulex parviflorus). Erosion following high intensity rainfall affects physicochemical soil properties. As a consequence, plant cover is reduced and specific composition affected, changing the previous relationship between obligate seeder and resprouter species. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  Abstract                 = {In the past two centuries, anthropogenic fire suppression has affected many biomes, including boreal forests. Absence of fire in the boreal zone is often linked to declining soil fertility and increased carbon sequestration in the humus through changes in NPP and litter decomposition. We studied tree litterfall and litter decomposition for thirty lake islands in the boreal forested zone of Sweden, which differ naturally in fire regime: larger islands have burned far more frequently than smaller ones because they are intercepted more often by lightning. We used litter trays to show that the ratio of twig to foliar litterfall for Picea abies with prolonged absence of fire is largely responsible for the concomitant increased twig proportion in the total litterfall. We hypothesised that the increased twig proportion in the litterfall with time since fire would affect overall decomposition by reducing net litter quality and through impairing decomposition of associated foliar litters. We established a litter decomposition mesocosm experiment based on litter from the three main tree species found on the islands. From each of the thirty islands, we prepared a set of litterbags comprising three mixtures (all foliar litters combined, all twig litters combined, and all twig and foliar litters combined), plus monotypes (i.e. each of the separate foliage and twig litters for each species). Unlike most studies, we used the natural litterfall proportions in the mixtures. We found a (negative) effect of time since wildfire on decomposition rate for only the foliage-twig mixtures, although twig litter did not inhibit the decomposition of foliar litter within these mixtures. The reduced decomposition rate in the foliage-twig mixture from the small islands was therefore due to the increased proportion of twigs in the mixtures from these islands. Our results suggest that, with prolonged absence of fire, the increase of twig proportion in the foliage-twig litterfall for P. abies combined with the shift to canopy dominance by P. abies may be important in contributing to reduced decomposition rates in boreal forest soils.},

  Abstract                 = { Vegetation recovery from fire has been widely studied at the stand level in many types of terrestrial ecosystems, but factors controlling regeneration at the landscape scale are less well known. Over large areas, fire history, climate, topography, and dominant type of vegetation may affect postfire response. Increased fire frequency, as is occurring in some mediterranean-type ecosystems, may reduce ecosystem resilience, i.e., the ability to recover the pre-disturbance state. We used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Landsat imagery to monitor vegetation recovery after Successive fires in a 32 100-km(2) area of Catalonia (northeastern Spain) between 1975 and 1993. In areas burned twice, NDVI patterns indicated that regrowth after 70 mo was lower after the second fire than after the first. This trend was observed several years after burning, but not immediately following fire. Green biomass after the second fire significantly increased with longer intervals of time between fires. There was also a positive correlation between postfire NDVI and mean rainfall, whereas a negative correlation was found between NDVI and solar radiation. Forests dominated by resprouting Quercus spp. were more resilient to fire, but they showed a larger decrease in resilience after the second fire than did forests dominated by Pinus spp. that regenerate from seed. We conclude that the use of time series satellite images may help to gain further insights in postfire vegetation dynamics over large regions and long time periods.},

  Abstract                 = {Fire performs many beneficial ecosystem functions in dry forests and rangelands across much of North America. In the last century, however, the role of fire has been dramatically altered by numerous anthropogenic factors acting as root causes of the current fire crisis, including widespread logging, road building, fire suppression, habitat fragmentation, urban development, livestock grazing, and, more recently, climate change. The intensity and extent of fires in the western United States, specifically, have dramatically increased over the past several decades. Such shifts in fire behavior have triggered sweeping policy changes that were intended to prevent or contain fires but that pose significant risks to the integrity of ecosystems and the role fire historically played in shaping them. Here, we provide a social and ecological context for summarizing this special issue on fires, including general guidelines and principles for managers concerned about balancing the risks of inaction against the risks of action over extensive areas. Fundamental to our understanding of fire is the notion that it is extremely variable, has multiple causes, and requires ecological solutions that are sensitive to spatial scale and context Therefore, forest managers must recognize that different forest types have different fire regimes and require fundamentally different fire- management policies. Furthermore, to restore or maintain ecological integrity, including the role of fire, treatments need to be tailored to site-specific conditions with an adaptive approach. We provide a conceptual framework for prioritizing fuel treatments and restoration activities in the wildlands-urban intermix versus those in wildland areas farther from human settlement. In general, the science of conservation biology has much to offer in helping to shape wildfire policy direction; however, conservation biologists must become more engaged to better ensure that policy decisions are based on sound science and that ecological risks are incorporated.},

Burns were conducted in late June to early July following seed dispersal and senescence of desirable grasses and forbs but prior to viable seed production in yellow starthistle. After the first year burn, there was no significant reduction in yellow starthistle cover the following spring and summer. Despite the lack of control, the first year burn reduced the yellow starthistle soil seedbank by 74% and the number of seedlings the following spring by 83%. However, total plant diversity and species richness increased dramatically in the burned areas. This was due primarily to an increase in the number of native broadleaf species. A second burn the next summer (1995-1997 site) reduced seedbank, seedling density, and summer vegetative cover the following year by 94, 92, and 85%, respectively, while maintaining significantly higher native plant cover and richness. A third consecutive summer burn decreased yellow starthistle seedbank and seedling density by 96, 98, and 85%, respectively in the 1995-1997 burn site. Three consecutive years of burning in the 1993-1995 site reduced yellow starthistle seedbank and seedling density by over 99% and summer vegetative cover by 91%. These results indicate that prescribed burning can be an effective tool for the management of yellow starthistle and can have a long-term benefit on native broadleaf diversity and richness.},

  Abstract                 = {Background and Aims Tersonia cyathiflora (Gyrostemonaceae) is a fire ephemeral with an obligate requirement for smoke to germinate. Whether it is stimulated to germinate by 3-methyl-2H-furo[2,3-c]pyran-2-one (karrikinolide, KAR1), the butenolide isolated from smoke that stimulates the germination of many other smoke-responsive species, is tested. Methods Seeds of T. cyathiflora were buried in autumn following collection and were exhumed 1 year later, as this alleviates dormancy and enables seeds to germinate in response to smoke-water. Exhumed seeds were tested with smoke-water and KAR1. Fresh preparations of these solutions were again tested on seeds exhumed 2 months later under a broader range of conditions. They were also tested on Grevillea eriostachya (Proteaceae) and Stylidium affine (Stylidiaceae) to confirm the activity of KAR1. Key Results T. cyathiflora seeds germinated in response to smoke-water but not to KAR1. In contrast, G. eriostachya and S. affine germinated in response to both smoke-water and KAR1. Conclusions Although many smoke-responsive seeds germinate in the presence of KAR1, this does not apply universally. This suggests that other chemical(s) in smoke-water may play an important role in stimulating the germination of certain species.},

  Abstract                 = {In pyrogenic ecosystems, responses of resprouting woody vegetation may depend more on fire season than on intensity. I explored this hypothesis by examining fire season and intensity effects on response of Prosopis glandulosa, a resprouting shrub in Chihuahuan desert grasslands of the south-western United States. Clipping as well as low and high intensity fires ( natural and added fuels, respectively) were applied during the 1999 growing season and the 2000 dormant season. Both fire season and intensity affected shrub responses. Numbers of resprouts increased 16%, and heights increased 8% after dormant season versus growing season treatments of fire and clipping combined. Height and resprout number decreased with increased fire intensity. Fire season and intensity effects on canopy area and stem growth were generally not detected. My results do not support the above hypothesis. Instead, fire season and intensity influence shrub responses in different ways via different mechanisms. Prosopis glandulosa has the potential to respond more after dormant season than growing season fires, perhaps as determined by carbohydrate availability in underground organs at the time of fire. However, realization of this potential is contingent on fire intensity as influenced primarily by fuel amount. In turn, fire intensity will determine the amount and duration of heat penetration into soils and thus the amount of damage to growing points of underground organs.},

Treatments were assigned randomly to eight 12 x 8 m plots within each of two blocks. Following fires in June 1995, unfenced plots were exposed to livestock grazing over 4 years. Plots were established that either included or excluded P. glandulosa. Perennial grass cover, primarily Bouteloua eriopoda, decreased by 13% in burned plots but increased 5% in unburned areas. Conversely, perennial forb cover was 4% greater after fire. Perennial grass frequency decreased 30% more and perennial forb frequency increased 10% more following burning. Further, increases in evenness after fire resulted in a 225% increase in species diversity. Grazing also resulted in a decrease in perennial grass cover while frequency decreased 22% more in grazed than ungrazed plots. Only frequency and not cover of perennial forbs and annual grasses increased more following grazing. Presence of P. glandulosa had no differential effect on responses of non-shrub species. Fires were conducted during near drought conditions while grazing occurred during years of precipitation equivalent to the long-term average. Precipitation immediately following fire may be critical for recovery of B. eriopoda-dominated desert grasslands; relationships between fire and postfire precipitation patterns require future investigation.

  Abstract                 = {Savanna community structure has been described mostly at the regional level worldwide. Quantitative descriptions of vegetation patterns and relationships with substrate characteristics at more localized scales have received less attention. Our primary objective was to examine the distributions of herbs and shrubs/trees along local topographic gradients in headwater regions of longleaf pine savannas in the southeastern United States. We also examined whether herb patterns were structurally similar to those of shrubs/trees along the same topographic gradients and whether patterns were correlated with edaphic factors. Abundance data were collected within quadrats placed along transects from upslope savannas through mid-slope seepage bogs into lower-slope shrub/tree zones within Louisiana and Florida. beta-flexible cluster analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling were used to delineate herbaceous species communities. Ordination was performed separately on shrub/tree abundance data. The herb-based classifications were also used to delineate shrub/tree communities, providing an indirect means of comparing herb to shrub/tree distributions. In Louisiana, three herbaceous communities were sharply delineated along elevation gradients of several meters and were strongly correleated with soil moisture. In Florida, three similar herbaceous communities were less discrete along elevation gradients of < 1 meter. In both regions, shrub/tree distributions were much broader and appeared less sensitive than herbs to changes in environmental gradients. Coefficients of variation indicated that, in general, herbaceous species were more narrowly distributed than shrubs/trees along localized elevation gradients in both Louisiana and Florida. Alterations of fire regimes (fire suppression, dormant-season fires) may have resulted in expanded distributions of shrubs/trees, but not herbs.},

  Abstract                 = {Woody plants in fire-frequented ecosystems commonly resprout from underground organs after fires. Responses to variation in characteristics of fire regimes may be a function of plant physiological status or fire intensity. Although these hypotheses have been explored for trees in southeastern longleaf pine (Pines palustris) savannas, responses of other life forms and stages have not been studied. We examined effects of fire season and frequency, geography, habitat, and underground organ morphology on resprouting of shrubs. In 1994, we located replicated sites, each containing two habitats, upslope savannas and downslope seepages, in Louisiana and Florida. Each site, which contained quadrats located along transects within a 30 X 60 m plot, was burned either during the dormant or growing season and then reburned similarly two years later. Maximum fire temperatures were measured, and densities of shrub stems were censused in quadrats before and after fires. Shrubs collectively resprouted more following dormant than growing-season fires, regardless of habitat or geographic region. After repeated dormant-season fires, collective densities in seepages of both regions and densities of root-crown-bearing shrubs in Florida seepages were greater than those initially and after repeated growing-season fires. Shrub responses were generally unrelated to fire temperatures, supporting the hypothesis that resprouting of shrubs may be more dependent on their physiological status at the time of fires. There was, nonetheless, an inverse relationship between collective and root-crown-bearing shrub densities following repeated fires and maximum fire temperatures in Florida seepages. Anthropogenic dormant-season fires over many decades may have resulted in increases in shrub densities in longleaf pine savannas, especially seepages. Repeated growing-season fires, however, neither increased nor reduced densities of established shrubs. Long-term shifts in characteristics of fire regimes, even in fire-frequented habitats, may produce effects that are not reversible in the short term (<10 yr) by simply reintroducing prescribed fires that resemble those that occurred naturally during the growing season.},

In contrast, in a spatially-structured population, there is a unique ESS for any given set of parameters; the outcome is determined by how effective allelopathy is in relation to its costs. Furthermore, in a spatially-structured environment, a dynamic equilibrium may be sustained among a colicin-sensitive type, a high colicin-producing type, and a ''cheater'' that expends less on colicin production but is resistant.

  Abstract                 = {Reciprocal selection is the underlying mechanism for host-parasite coevolutionary arms races. Its driving force is the reduction of host lifespan or fecundity that is caused by a parasite. Parasites evolve to optimize host exploitation, while hosts evolve to minimize the 'parasite-induced' loss of fitness (virulence). Research on the evolution of virulence has mostly emphasized the role of parasite evolution in determining virulence. However, host evolution, accelerated by sexual recombination, contributes to the evolution and expression of virulence as well. The Red Queen hypothesis predicts that genetic variation among host offspring facilitates selection for reduced virulence. Here, we outline a synthesis between current thinking about the evolution of virulence and the evolution of sex.},

  Abstract                 = {It is hard to defend the view that biotic communities represent a simple and predictable response to the abiotic environment. Biota and the abiotic environment interact, and the environment of an individual certainly includes its neighbors and visitors in the community. The complexity of community assembly calls forth a quest for general principles, yet current results and theories on assembly rules differ widely. Using a grassland microcosm as a model system, we manipulated fertility, disturbance by defoliation, soil/microclimate, and arrival order of species belonging to two groups differing in functional attributes. We analyzed the Outcome of community assembly dynamics in terms of species richness, invasibility, and species composition. The analyses revealed strong environmental control over species richness and invasibility. Species composition was mainly determined by the arrival order of species, indicating that historical contingency may change the outcome of community assembly. The probability for multiple equilibria appeared to increase with productivity and environmental stability. The importance of arrival order offers an explanation of the difficulties in predicting local occurrences of species in the field. In our experiment, variation in fertility and disturbance was controlling colonization with predictable effects on emergent community properties such as species richness. The key mechanism is suggested to be asymmetric competition, and our results show that this mechanism is relatively insensitive to the species through which it works. While our analyses indicate a positive and significant correlation between richness and invasibility, the significance disappears after accounting for the effect of the environment. The importance of arrival order (historical contingency) and environmental control supports the assumption of the unified neutral theory that different species within a trophic level can be considered functionally equivalent when it comes to community assembly. However, our results indicate that variation in asymmetric competition is the key factor determining the richness of the resulting communities, and this is far from neutral.},

  Abstract                 = {The role of fire in the maintenance of oak-dominated ecosystems is widely recognized. Fire exclusion results in structural and compositional shifts that alter fuelbed composition and structure, together influencing fire behavior and effects. To clarify the influence of overstory structure on fuels and fire intensity in oak woodlands and savannas, we exam- ined fuelbeds across a gradient from open grassland to Douglas-fir- (Pseudotsuga menzie- sii (Mirb.) Franco) invaded Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana Douglas ex Hook.) woodland in the Bald Hills of Redwood National Park, California, USA. Herbaceous mass decreased markedly from a high in grasslands (3.38 Mg ha-1) to a low in invaded woodlands (0.03 Mg ha-1), whereas leaf litter and woody fuel mass increased substantially along this gradient. Mean fire temperatures at 30 cm height ranged from 74.7 C in in- vaded woodland up to 207.9 C in grassland. Highly flammable grassland and savanna communities maintain heavy herbaceous mass, but low woody mass, favoring quick- spreading, relatively high-intensity fires. The encroachment of Douglas-fir into grasslands and oak-dominated communities dampens flammability through changes in fuelbed com- position and structure (e.g., the replacement of herbaceous fuels with woody fuels), un- derscoring the necessity for ecological restoration efforts that focus on fuelbed structure in addition to other common restoration goals.},

Our objective was to determine if late season fire of varying frequency results in divergent successional patterns in an early successional tallgrass prairie disturbed by grazing and cultivation. Specifically, we evaluated the influence of late-summer fires of varying frequency on community composition and species richness. We collected vegetation and environmental data on two sites burned in the late growing-season at varying frequencies. These communities differed in composition depending primarily on edaphic factors, time since the last burn, and year-to-year variation. We interpret the time effect as related to changes in species composition accompanying plant succession that followed disturbance either from cropping and heavy grazing on the loamy site or heavy grazing on the shallow site. Other unidentified factors also have a role in vegetation dynamics on this prairie. Community composition and species richness were not consistently responsive to frequency of growing-season fires.},

  Abstract                 = {Population size-structures, seed production, canopy seed storage (serotiny), and recruitment were investigated in relation to fire, drought and disease for a pair of co-occurring resprouting and non-sprouting shrub species from the genus Hakea (Proteaceae) in fire-prone Eucalyptus woodlands in western Victoria, Australia. The non-sprouter species, Hakea decurrens, showed faster height growth, higher seed production and higher seed viability than the resprouter, Hakea rostrata. Population size structures in stands up to 24 years since last fire showed no evidence of inter-fire recruitment for either species. Following a fire in 1990 in a mixed species stand 15-20 years old, the estimated number of viable seeds released from canopy-stored seed banks was approximately equal for both species. However, the rate of seedling establishment in the first year was about 10 times higher, and seedling suvivorship over the first 5 years was seven times higher, for the non-sprouter. Seedlings of Hakea decurrens and resprouts of Hakea rostrata began to produce seeds within three years of the last fire, while the few surviving seedlings of Hakea rostrata showed no evidence of reproductive maturity after six years. Inter-fire recruitment was recorded for the non-sprouter, Hakea decurrens, in the oldest stand (burned in 1967) between 24 and 28 years since last fire. This was associated with an increased rate of seed release from serotinous fruits due to the onset of high rates of adult plant mortality. High adult mortality and increased seed release correlated with increasing stand age, the occurrence of severe drought, and the likely presence of Phytophthora cinnamomi, a fungal pathogen which damages the root system, reducing water and nutrient uptake. There were no new recruits for the resprouter Hakea rostrata in this stand, but old plants continued to resprout from basal lignotubers and no mortality was observed. While recruitment of strongly serotinous shrub species is commonly described as being restricted to the immediate post-fire period, the present study illustrates that other events (e.g., senescence, drought, disease) can lead to recruitment of serotinous non-sprouters and may be important in the maintenance of populations during unusually long periods without fire.},

Seedling density, species richness and species composition were compared between replicated treated and control samples. A total of 5922 seedlings, comprising 59 plant species, was recorded from the soil samples over a period of 150 days. While a few species dominated (including Centrolepis strigosa, Wahlenbergia gracilenta and Ixodia achillaeoides), 26 species were represented by fewer than five seedlings and 18 species were restricted to single treatment types. With the exception of charred wood, all treatments led to a significant increase in seed germination relative to the control. The highest number of germinants was obtained for the smoke treatment, with a mean (+/- SE) of 12 547 +/- 449 seedlings m(-2). Heat treatments yielded intermediate densities, with means (+/- SE) varying between 7445 +/- 234 and 9133 +/- 445 seedlings m(-2). In comparison with the estimates of seed-bank sizes from other fire-prone ecosystems, these densities are high. Species richness differed significantly among treatments. Highest mean richness was recorded in the smoke treatment and lowest for the control and charred wood treatments. There were significant differences in seed-bank species composition between treatment types based on analysis of similarity (Anosim) using Bray-Curtis similarity. While heat was a specific requirement for triggering germination in hard-seeded species (e.g. Fabaceae), smoke was the most effective trigger for species from a broad range of other families.

  Abstract                 = {Fire is selectively shaping most of the traits of plants growing in fire-prone environments. However, seed size and other features related to seed production have not been studied in the light of the evolutionary role of fire. Our research tests the hypothesis that larger seeds have a higher chance of surviving wildfires and produce more vigorous seedlings with a lower death rate. To test this hypothesis the germination and early seedling growth of five Spanish pine species were studied. Weight, length and width of all seeds were measured. The biomass (fresh and dry weight) and length (root and total) of subsequent seedlings were also measured after 30 d from emergence. Seeds were submitted to elevated temperatures for periods in which the chance of survival was 50 % (calculated by means of a logistic model for each pine species). The differences observed among species suggests that fire may be adaptively shaping seed size in pines with larger seeds (Pinus canariensis and P. pinaster), because larger seeds are more likely to survive after heat shocks. Furthermore, in P. canariensis, seedlings after heat treatment are even larger than those submitted to control. In P. halepensis, despite being well adapted to fire, our results indicated no relationships between fire and seed characteristics. Finally, although heat treatment has a general adverse effect on seedling growth in the case of the two subalpine pines, we have detected a positive relationship between seed size and seedling growth but only in the largest seeds. This might also suggest the relevance of fire as a selective force for these pines which is outperformed by the relevance of dispersal and emergence time as adaptive traits in the post-fire scenario.

Simulations and a mean-field approximation have been used to study this neutral theory. As simulations have limitations of convergence and the mean-field approximation ignores dependencies between species' abundances when applied to species-abundance data, there is still no final conclusion whether the neutral theory or the traditional lognormal model describes community structure best. We present a novel analytical framework, based on the genealogy of individuals in the local community, to overcome the problems of previous approaches, and show, using Bayesian statistics, that the lognormal model provides a slightly better fit to the species-abundance distribution of a much-discussed tropical tree community. A key feature of our approach is that it shows the tight link between genetic and species diversity, which creates important perspectives to future integration of evolutionary and community ecological theory.},

  Abstract                 = {Freeze/thaw stress was examined in chaparral shrubs of the genus Ceanothus to determine the interactive effects of freezing and drought and to consider which is the more vulnerable component, the living leaves (symplast) or the non-living water transport system (apoplast). We hypothesized that where Ceanothus species co-occurred, the more inland species C. crassifolius would be more tolerant of low temperatures than the coastal species C. spinosus, both in terms of leaf survival (LT50, or the temperature at which there is 50% loss of function or viability) and in terms of resistance to freezing-induced embolism (measurements of percent loss hydraulic conductivity due to embolism following freeze/thaw). Cooling experiments on 2 m long winter-acclimated shoots resulted in LT50 values of about -10degreesC for C. spinosus versus -18degreesC for C. crassifolius. Freeze-thaw cycles resulted in no change in embolism when the plants were well hydrated (-0.7 to -2.0 MPa). However, when plants were dehydrated to -5.0 MPa, C. spinosus became 96% embolized with freeze/thaw, versus only 61% embolism for C. crassifolius. Stems of C. crassifolius became 90% and 97% embolized at -6.6 and -8.0 MPa, respectively, meaning that even in this species, stems could be more vulnerable than leaves under conditions of extreme water stress combined with freeze/thaw events. The dominance of C. crassifolius at colder sites and the restriction of C. spinosus to warmer sites are consistent with both the relative tolerance of their symplasts to low temperatures and the relative tolerance of their apoplasts to freeze events in combination with drought stress.},

Modifier models demonstrate, however, that equilibrium mean fitness can decrease during the evolution of recombination rates and is not always maximized. Therefore, optimality arguments do not successfully predict the conditions under which increased or decreased recombination will evolve. The results from modifier models indicate that decreased recombination rates are usually favored when the population is initially near a polymorphic equilibrium with linkage disequilibrium. When the population is subject to directional selection or to deleterious mutations, increased recombination may be favored under certain conditions, provided that there is negative epistasis among alleles.},

  Abstract                 = { Postfire regeneration in Cytisus oromediterraneus, a Mediterranean-basin mountain matorral species, shows a wide range of possibilities and variations in sexual and asexual regeneration. Its interpretation requires basic information on the below-ground structure of parent plants as well as on the origin and development of seedlings and various ramet (sprout clump) types: rootstock, basal-branch, and lateral-root ramets. Morphology and emergence of such ramets in C. oromediterraneus is similar to that in related species but with some specific features described here in detail. In order to determine if characteristics of 1-year-old populations depended on the age of the burned parent plants, two populations were investigated: (A 7-year-old, and B 14-year-old). In the most frequent populations in our study area, i.e. those from parent populations of ca. 7 years (A): a-plant density and biomass were highly variable and positively correlated; b-frequency distribution differed significantly from normal distribution for plant weight, but not for other parameters such as diameters, perimeter, and height, in which it did, however, show asymmetry; c-perimeter was the best parameter for estimating individuals' weight; d-there was a higher number of seedlings than ramets but their biomass was smaller; e-the size of seedlings and ramets showed wide variation. In comparison with population A (7-year-old) population B (14-year-old) showed: significantly higher density, slightly lower biomass, higher number of small individuals, mainly seedlings, and less vigorous resprouting. In general, 1 year after fire, Cytisus oromeditarraneus population density mainly depends on the germination response, while the above-ground biomass mainly depends on the vegetative response and the intensity of both of them is conditioned by parent plant age.

  Abstract                 = {The effect of an experimental low-intensity fire on the soil seed bank and its consequences on the early stages of post-disturbance succession-were analyzed. The hypothesis that low-intensity fire may produce a population decline of hard-seeded species by the elimination of established plants and the lack of a seed germination promotion effect was investigated. Consecutive pre- and post-burning soil samplings revealed extremely low impact of fire on seed banks. In contrast, some specific seed banks increased with fire, probably due to a seed rain from fire-opening of capsule fruits. Fire neither promoted germination of hard-coated seeds nor affected their viability. Both the length of the seed-unproductive juvenile phase and post-fire habitat conditions were revealed as critical in determining the recovery of hard-seeded species after a low-intensity fire. Species with a short life cycle produced seeds in the year subsequent to the disturbance, ensuring a progressive moderate recovery from the few individuals which emerged after fire. This was particularly true in the southern exposure, where other seed-softening factors not exclusively related to fire may operate in a more intense way, compensating the null effect on germination of the low-fire intensity. For Cistus clusii, with a relatively long juvenile-phase span (3 years), low post-fire germination coincided with a long seed-unproductive period, which finally overlapped with a dramatic seed bank viability depletion (63-68%). In the northern exposure, fire resulted in a complete extinction of this species.},

  Abstract                 = {Bark beetles (Scolytidae) are commonly recognized as the most important mortality agent in western coniferous forests. In this study, we describe the flight periodicity in response to synthetic aggregation pheromones of the four major pine-infesting bark beetles in California, 1991-1994. The presence of all four species was confirmed at five sampling locations along a latitudinal gradient (725 km) within the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Mountains. A total of 1,592,448 Dendroctonus brevicomis LeConte, 65,815 D. ponderosae Hopkins, 113,257 Ips paraconfusus Lanier, and 4783 l. pini (Say) were collected. There were large differences in the numbers of beetles caught among sites. Dendroctonus bievicomis was active throughout the entire sampling interval (April-November) with peak activity occurring in June and July. The seasonal flight trends of D. ponderosae were similar to that of D. brevicomis at four of five locations. In general, the flight activity of l. paraconfusus ceased or substantially declined by mid-August. The flight periodicity of L pini was similar to l. paraconfusits with peak flight occurring prior to July followed by a general decrease throughout the year. Patterns differed slightly among locations and did not appear to be strongly influenced by latitude. The potential implications of these results to forest management are discussed.},

Ecosystems on moderately fertile sandstone soil and with a typical mix of moderately fast-growing sandstone species, responded to elevated pCO(2) with decreases in mid-season evapotranspiration of nearly 50%. This pattern reversed at the end of the growing season, and sandstone ecosystems under elevated pCO(2) continued active transpiration farther into the summer drought. The sandstone ecosystems appeared to convert mid-season water conservation into increased late-season growth. Effects of increased pCO(2) on ecosystem evapotranspiration were much smaller in ecosystems with very infertile serpentine soil and a diverse mixture of slow-growing serpentine species.},

The burning characteristics tested in this study address important aspects of nonwoody fuel flammability in coniferous forests. Ponderosa pine. Jeffrey pine, Monterey pine, coast redwood, knobcone pine, giant sequoia, and sugar pine ranked in the upper half of most of the burn categories. These highly flammable species are prominent in communities for which fire return intervals are two to four decades. Lodgepole pine, western redcedar, Douglas-fir, Pacific silver fir, subalpine fir and western hemlock seldom ranked in the upper half of any of the burn categories. The needles of these species are less flammable than the upper group of seven. The fire return intervals for the communities in which they grow are commonly two or more centuries.},

  Abstract                 = {A spatially explicit landscape model of disturbance and vegetation succession, LANDIS, was used to examine the effect of fire regime on landscape patterns of functional group dominance in the shrublands and forests of the southern California foothills and mountains. Three model treatments, frequent (35 year), moderate (70 year), and infrequent (1050 year) fire cycles, were applied to the landscape for 500 year. The model was calibrated and tested using a dataset representing an initial random distribution of six plant functional groups on an even-aged landscape. Calibration of the three fire regime treatments resulted in simulation of fire cycles within 7% of these intended values when fire cycles were averaged across ten replicated model runs per treatment. Within individual 500-year model runs, the error in the simulated fire cycle (average area burned per decade) reached 11% for the moderate and frequent fire cycle treatments and 53% for infrequent. The infrequent fire regime resulted in an old landscape dominated by the three most shade tolerant and long-lived functional groups, while shorter-lived and less shade tolerant seeders and resprouters disappeared from the landscape. The moderate fire regime, similar to what is considered the current fire regime in the southern California foothills, resulted in a younger landscape where the facultative resprouter persisted along with the long-lived shade tolerant functional groups, but the obligate seeder with low fire tolerance disappeared, despite its moderate shade tolerance, The frequent fire regime resulted in the persistence of all functional groups on the landscape with more even cover, but the same rank order as under the moderate regime. The model, originally developed for northern temperate forests, appears to be useful for simulating the disturbance regime in this fire-prone Mediterranean-type ecosystem.

Regeneration was dense and highlyaggregated at all sites but the frequent-fire overstory was random to uniform in spatial distribution and relatively open while the fire-excluded sites hadclumped overstory trees with a high density of smaller trees. Dominance by sprouting species was greatest at the fire-excluded sites. Mortality was spatiallyaggregated at ail sites, consistent both with thinning by fire and density-dependent mortality, but competitive self-thinning appeared insufficient to counteractthe increased tree density without fire. The return of fire after 29 years of exclusion reduced tree density but left overstory trees aggregated and led to vigorousoak and alder sprouting. Frequent fire disturbance is considered essential to maintain open pine forests; fire exclusion with or without subsequent fire appearsto lead to denser forests dominated by smaller trees of sprouting species.},

  Abstract                 = {Fire regime characteristics of high-elevation forests on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, Arizona, were reconstructed from fire scar analysis, remote sensing, tree age, and forest structure measurements, a first attempt at detailed reconstruction of the transition from surface to stand-replacing fire patterns in the Southwest. Tree densities and fire-/non-fire-initiated groups were highly mixed over the landscape, so distinct fire-created stands could not be delineated from satellite imagery or the oldest available aerial photos. Surface fires were common from 1700 to 1879 in the 4,400 ha site, especially on S and W aspects. Fire dates frequently coincided with fire dates measured at study sites at lower elevation, suggesting that pre-1880 fire sizes may have been very large. Large fires, those scarring 25% or more of the sample trees, were relatively infrequent, averaging 31 years between burns. Four of the five major regional fire years occurred in the 1700s, followed by a 94-year gap until 1879. Fires typically occurred in significantly dry years ( Palmer Drought Stress Index), with severe drought in major regional fire years. Currently the forest is predominantly spruce-fir, mixed conifer, and aspen. In contrast, dendroecological reconstruction of past forest structure showed that the forest in 1880 was very open, corresponding closely with historical ( 1910) accounts of severe fires leaving partially denuded landscapes. Age structure and species composition were used to classify sampling points into fire-initiated and non-fire-initiated groups. Tree groups on nearly 60% of the plots were fire-initiated; the oldest such groups appeared to have originated after severe fires in 1782 or 1785. In 1880, all fire-initiated groups were less than 100 years old and nearly 25% of the groups were less than 20 years old. Non-fire-initiated groups were significantly older ( oldest 262 years in 1880), dominated by ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, or white fir, and occurred preferentially on S and W slopes. The mixed-severity fire regime, transitioning from lower-elevation surface fires to mixed surface and stand-replacing fire at higher elevations, appeared not to have been stable over the temporal and spatial scales of this study. Information about historical fire regime and forest structure is valuable for managers but the information is probably less specific and stable for high-elevation forests than for low-elevation ponderosa pine forests.},

  Abstract                 = {Relatively intense burning has been suggested as a possible alternative to the restoration of pre-European settlement forest conditions and fire regime in mixed conifer forests, in contrast to thinning of trees and light prescribed burning. In 1993 a management-ignited fire in a dense, never-harvested forest in Grand Canyon National Park escaped prescription and burned with greater intensity and severity than anticipated. We sampled the burned site and an adjacent unburned site (270 ha each) 6 years after the fire to assess burn effects on tree structure (species composition, size and age distributions, regeneration, and snags), forest floor fuels, and coarse woody debris. Tree structure before fire-regime disruption (1879 CE) was reconstructed with dendroecological techniques. By 6 years after burn the fire reduced average tree density (331 trees/ha) and basal area (28.5 m(2) /ha) to levels similar to pre-European reference conditions (approximately 246 trees/ha and 28.5 m(2)/ha). Mortality was concentrated in fire-susceptible species, especially white fir, restoring dominance by fire-resistant ponderosa pine. Forest floor fuels were reduced, and regeneration by aspen and understory plants was vigorous. Densities of large snags and logs were high. However the fire also killed a high proportion of old-growth trees, especially aspen. Burning created more spatial variability in forest structure than was present before fire-regime disruption by killing many trees in some areas of the site but few in other areas. The intentional use of severe burning would be challenging to managers because of the increased risk of escaped rites, but the ecological outcome of this particular wildfire was not inconsistent with ecological restoration goals for this ecosystem type.},

  Abstract                 = {Aim Compare contemporary with pre-fire-disruption forest structures, assessing the influence of factors that caused ecological change and evaluating remote sites as relatively natural areas. Location Grand Canyon National Park contains the largest never-harvested and long-term ungrazed forest ecosystem in Arizona, providing valuable sites for measuring natural variability. However, anthropogenic disruption of natural fire regimes since Euro-American settlement c. 1880 has led to changes in forest structure. Methods We compared species composition, tree structure, regeneration, and canopy cover on large (135-603 ha) ponderosa pine-dominated study sites: (1) isolated points on the North Rim where some surface fires continued after 1880, (2) a higher-elevation North Rim site where fire has been excluded and (3) a South Rim site, also without recent fire, with a paired Kaibab National Forest site. Forest tree structure prior to fire-regime disruption was reconstructed with dendroecological techniques. Results Before fire exclusion, all sites had relatively low tree density (140-246 trees ha(-1)) dominated by large trees (basal area 9.1-28.5 m(2) ha(-1)), primarily ponderosa pine or pine/Gambel oak on the South Rim. Currently all sites are relatively dense (389955 trees ha(-1), 14.1-41.3 m(2) ha(-1)) but patterns of species composition and regeneration differed substantially with fire regime and elevation. Regeneration at continued-fire sites was primarily through sprouting species, Gambel oak and New Mexican locust, forming a shrubby midstorey under a relatively open pine canopy. In contrast, all fire-excluded sites were dense with seed-reproducing conifer species. Main conclusions Comparison of change caused by climate fluctuation, tree cutting, fire exclusion, livestock herbivory, and wildlife herbivory, suggests that fire regime alteration appears to have played the greatest role. The remote North Rim sites provide a close analogue to conditions prior to fire regime disruption, a contemporary example of the forest characteristics that might have been extant had recent human-caused disruption of disturbance regimes and heavy resource extraction not occurred. They merit broader study of natural variability on a range of ecological variables in ponderosa pine ecosystems.},

  Abstract                 = {Three treatments designed to initiate the process of restoring the surface fire regime and open forest structure of a southwestern ponderosa pine forest were compared on the Kaibab National Forest along the Grand Canyon's South Rim. The treatments were: (1) full restoration (FULL)-thinning trees to emulate stand structure prior to fire regime disruption ca. 1887, forest floor fuel treatment, and prescribed burning, (2) minimal thinning (MIN)-removing young trees only around living old-growth (pre-1887) trees, fuel treatment, and prescribed burning, (3) burn-only (BURN)-representing the current management policy in Grand Canyon National Park (GCNP), and (4) CONTROL. Each treatment was applied to a 12 ha unit. Compared to reconstructed 1887 conditions, all study sites were much more dense prior to treatment (94-176 trees/ha in 1887, compared to 783-3693 trees/ha in 1997). However, basal area increases were less striking (12.6-20.3 in 1887, 17.5-27.0 m(2)/ha in 1997), reflecting past harvest and dwarf mistletoe reduction treatments that removed many large pines. In 2000, 1 year after treatment, tree densities were reduced to 11, 23, and 37 of pre-treatment levels in the FULL, MIN, and BURN treatments, respectively. Understory plant communities showed significant declines in richness and plant frequency across years, probably due to a severe drought in 2000 (60% of average precipitation). No differences in plant communities were observed across treatments, despite the mechanized disturbance associated with tree removal in the FULL treatment. Prescribed fire behavior (flame length, flaming zone depth) and effects (bole char, crown scorch) were similar across all three burned treatments. Simulated fire behavior under dry, windy conditions was reduced in all three treatments compared to the control. The FULL treatment was much less susceptible to crownfire due to reduced crown bulk density and crown fuel load and increased crown base height. Crownfire susceptibility of the BURN treatment was only slightly reduced, while the MIN treatment was intermediate. Compared to the reference conditions of forest structure, the FULL treatment represented the most rapid and comprehensive restoration treatment, although the residual stand was at the low end of historical density. The BURN treatment thinned many small trees but had minor effects on crownfire susceptibility. Effects of the MIN treatment fell between FULL and BURN. The experimental treatments may be useful for the creation of defensible firebreaks near developments, roads, and boundaries with the FULL treatment, supplemented by MIN and BURN treatments over larger areas.

  Abstract                 = {We applied detailed forest reconstructions measured on broad-scale plot grids to initialize forest simulation modeling in 1880 and modeled spatially explicit changes in canopy fuels (canopy biomass, canopy bulk density, species composition) and potential fire behavior (crowning index) through 2040, a 160-year period. The study sites spanned a 500-m elevational gradient from ponderosa pine forest through higher-elevation mixed conifer, aspen, and spruce-fir forests on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park in northern Arizona. The simulations were relatively accurate, as assessed by comparing the simulation output in the year 2000 with field data collected in 1997-2001, because a regionally calibrated simulator was used (Central Rockies variant of the Forest Vegetation Simulator) and because we added regeneration by species and density in the correct historical sequence. Canopy biomass increased at all sites, rising an average of 122% at the low-elevation sites and 279% at the high-elevation sites. The intermediate-elevation site, where mixed conifer vegetation predominated, began with the highest canopy biomass in 1880 but had the lowest increase through 2040 (39%). Canopy bulk density increased roughly in parallel with canopy biomass; however, density values were considered less accurate in non-contemporary dates because they were based on assumptions about canopy volume. Species composition of canopy fuels was consistent at low elevation (ponderosa pine) but shifted strongly toward mesic species at higher elevations, where ponderosa pine declined in absolute as well as relative terms. Potential crown fire behavior was assessed with the Nexus model in terms of crowning index (CI), the windspeed required to sustain active canopy burning. CI values decreased 23-80% over the modeled period. Canopy fuel and CI values were mapped across the entire North Rim landscape. At a threshold windspeed of 45 km/h, only 6% of the landscape was susceptible to active crown fire in 1880 but 33% was susceptible by 2000. Implications of the changes over time and space include altered contemporary habitats and the high likelihood of rapid, broad-scale disturbance by fire. If managers choose to intervene to reduce canopy fuel mass and continuity, actions should be guided by the distinct ecological attributes of the different forest types. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

  Abstract                 = {Fire regimes were reconstructed from fire-scarred trees on five large forested study sites (135 - 810 ha) on the North and South Rims at Grand Canyon National Park. Adequacy of sampling was tested with cumulative sample curves, effectiveness of fire recording on individual trees, tree age data, and the occurrence of 20th Century fires which permitted comparison of fire-scar data with fire- record data, a form of modern calibration for the interpretation of fire- scar results. Fire scars identified all 13 recorded fires > 8 ha on the study sites since 1924, when record keeping started. Records of fire season and size corresponded well with fire- scar data. We concluded that the sampling and analysis methods were appropriate and accurate for this area, in contrast to the suggestion that these methods are highly uncertain in ponderosa pine forests. Prior to 1880, fires were most frequent on low-elevation 'islands' of ponderosa pine forest formed by plateaus or points ( Weibull Median Probability Intervals [WMPI] 3.0-3.9 years for all fires, 6.3-8.6 years for 'large' fires scarring 25% or more of the sampled trees). Fires were less frequent on a higher-elevation 'mainland' site located further to the interior of the North Rim ( WMPI 5.1 years all fires, 8.7 years large fires), but fires tended to occur in relatively drier years and individual fires were more likely to burn larger portions of the study site. In contrast to the North Rim pattern of declining fire frequency with elevation, a low-elevation 'mainland' site on the South Rim had the longest fire- free intervals prior to European settlement (WMPI 6.5 years all fires, 8.9 years large fires). As in much of western North America, surface fire regimes were interrupted around European settlement, 1879 on the North Rim and 1887 on the South Rim. However, either two or three large surface fires have burned across each of the geographically remote point and plateau study sites of the western North Rim since settlement. To some extent, these sites may be rare representatives of nearly-natural conditions due to the relatively undisrupted fire regimes in a never-harvested forest setting.},

  Abstract                 = {Pyrogenic plants dominate many ﬁre-prone ecosystems. Their prevalence suggests some advantage to their enhanced ﬂammability, but researchers have had difﬁculty tying pyrogenicity to individual-level advantages. Based on our review, we propose that enhanced ﬂammability in ﬁre-prone ecosystems should protect the belowground organs and nearby propagules of certain individual plants during ﬁres. We base this hypothesis on ﬁve points: (1) organs and propagules by which many ﬁre-adapted plants survive ﬁres are vulnerable to elevated soil temperatures during ﬁres; (2) the degree to which burning plant fuels heat the soil depends mainly on residence times of ﬁres and on fuel location relative to the soil; (3) ﬁres and ﬁre effects are locally heterogeneous, meaning that individual plants can affect local soil heating via their fuels; (4) how a plant burns can thus affect its ﬁtness; and (5) in many cases, natural selection in ﬁre-prone habitats should therefore favor plants that burn rapidly and retain fuels off the ground. We predict an advantage of enhanced ﬂammability for plants whose fuels inﬂuence local ﬁre characteristics and whose regenerative tissues or propagules are affected by local variation in ﬁres. Our ‘‘pyrogenicity as protection’’ hypothesis has the potential to apply to a range of life histories. We discuss implications for ecological and evolutionary theory and suggest considerations for testing the hypothesis.},

Fuel beds and firebrands were selected among the most common in southern Europe. Regarding fuel bed flammability, results show that grasses are more flammable than litter and, among litters, Pinus species are the most flammable. The increase in bulk density and fuel moisture content involves an increase in the time to ignition, and a decrease in the other flammability parameters. The capability of firebrands to ignite fuel beds is higher when the firebrands drop in the flaming phase and with no air flow than in glowing phase with air flow. Logistic regression models to predict fuel bed ignition probability were developed. As a whole, results show a relationship between ignition probability of fuel bed and type or weight of firebrands. Pinus pinaster cone scale, P. halepensis cone scale, and Eucalyptus globulus leaf and bark can have ignition probabilities at least twice higher than pine bark when falling while in flaming combustion.},

  Abstract                 = {Some clonal organisms may live for thousands of years and show no signs of senescence, while others consistently die after finite life spans. Using two models, we examined how stage-specific life-history rates of a clone's modules determine whether a genetic individual escapes senescence by replacing old modules with new ones. When the rates of clonal or sexual reproduction and survival of individual modules decline with age, clones are more likely to experience senescence. In addition, the models predict that there is a greater tendency to find senescence in terms of a decline in the rate of sexual reproduction with clone age than in terms of an increase in the probability of clone mortality, unless rates of sexual reproduction increase dramatically with module stage. Using a matrix model modified to represent the clonal lifestyle, we show how a trade-off between sexual and clonal reproduction could result in selection for or against clonal senescence. We also show that, in contrast to unitary organisms, the strength of selection on life-history traits can increase with the age of a clone even in a growing population, countering the evolution of senescence.},

  Abstract                 = {Interspecific comparisons have played a prominent role in evolutionary biology at least since the time of Charles Darwin. Since 1985, the ''comparative method'' has been revitalized by new analytical techniques that use phylogenetic information and by increased availability of phylogenies (often from molecular data sets), Because species descend from common ancestors in a hierarchical fashion, related species tend to resemble each other (elephants look like elephants); therefore, cross-species data sets generally do not comprise Independent and identically distributed data points, Phylogenetically based statistical methods attempt to account for this fact, Phylogenetic methods allow traditional topics in comparative and ecological physiology to be addressed with greater rigor, including the form of allometric relationships and whether physiological phenotypes vary predictably in relation to behavior, ecology or environmental characteristics, which provides evidence about adaptation, They can also address new topics, such as whether rates of physiological evolution have differed among lineages (clades), and where and when a phenotype first evolved, We present brief overviews of three phylogenetically based statistical methods: phylogenetically independent contrasts, Monte Carlo computer simulations to obtain null distributions of test statistics, and phylogenetic autocorrelation, In a new result, we show analytically how to use independent contrasts to estimate ancestral values and confidence intervals about them, These confidence intervals often exceed the range of variation observed among extant species, which points out the relatively great uncertainty inherent in such inferences, The use of phylogenies should become as common as the use of body size and scaling relationships in the analysis of physiological diversity.},

Ecosystem- specific net primary productivity, litter decomposition rate, and total soil carbon and nitrogen varied significantly with field age, and correlated with community-aggregated (i.e., weighed according to the relative abundance of species) functional leaf traits. The three easily measurable traits tested, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, and nitrogen concentration, provide a simple means to scale up from organ to ecosystem functioning in complex plant communities. We propose that they be called "functional markers," and be used to assess the impacts of community changes on ecosystem properties induced, in particular, by global change drivers.},

Seedling growth, survival and fecundity were recorded in burned and unburned plots during 3 years for a first cohort and during 1 year for a second cohort initiated 1 year later. 2 Seedling growth and survival rates were significantly higher in unburned plots, with larger seedlings surviving burning better. Regardless of treatment/fire regime, seedlings grew faster when located further from the nearest tuft, but differences between clones showed that growth rate also had a genetic basis in this apomictic species. Adult survival was always high, but exclusion of fire increased size, and therefore age, at maturity. Fire therefore affects life-history traits in this grass species of fire-prone environments. 3 Size-structured matrix models were constructed separately for each fire treatment, incorporating demographic and fire parameters estimated from field data. 4 The asymptotic population growth rate was higher in the unburned model (lambda = 1.23) than in the burned one (lambda = 1.07), indicating that the population of H. diplandra expanded quickly in the absence of fire. 5 Overall, results indicate that annual burning limits population growth rate. Less frequent, but still regular fires may allow establishment while preventing the accumulation of litter and accelerating nutrient recycling; thus lead to more stable populations than in the total absence of fire.},

Using an ex perimental approach, we quantified (1) the environmental and genetic components of awn length variation, (2) the influence of awn length variation on seed burial depth, (3) the effect of awn length on seed germination and seedling survival rates in burned and unburned plots, and (4) the potential role of fire intensity in selecting diaspores with different awn lengths. Awn length varied from 35 to 70 mm and was highly heritable (H(2) = 0.63). },

  Abstract                 = {1 Serotiny, the capacity to retain seed in the plant canopy, has evolved in many species under the selective pressure of fires. The effect of disturbance type (lethal or nonlethal fire), time-since-fire and different fire regimes on the serotiny of jack pine (Pinus banksiana), was evaluated in populations from two adjacent landscapes in the southern part of the Canadian boreal forest. The island landscape (Lake Duparquet) has a complex fire regime of small fires of variable intensity, whereas the adjacent mainland has a fire regime characterized by large intense fires. 2 Twenty-four jack pine populations (11 island and 13 mainland) on xeric sites were sampled for the degree of serotiny of trees, Fire history and age structure were reconstructed for each population using the fire scar method. For each tree, recruitment was categorized as after a lethal fire, after a nonlethal fire or in the absence of fire. 3 Likelihood chi-square tests were used to investigate the variation in serotiny at individual, population and landscape levels. 4 At the individual level, the results support our prediction that the occurrence of lethal fires favours trees with high serotiny while low serotiny trees are favoured by other types of disturbances. 5 At the population level, the frequency of low serotiny trees increases with time since stand initiation, as a result of higher establishment opportunities after disturbances other than lethal fires. The proportion of low serotiny trees also increases with the occurrence of nonlethal fires. 6 Significant differences were found between the two landscapes. On the mainland, serotinous trees were more abundant, whereas on the islands where nonlethal fires were recorded, low serotiny trees were more frequent. These results support the hypothesis that fire imposes differential selective pressures on serotiny in jack pine.},

  Abstract                 = {The main objective of this study was to determine empirically if the absence of serotinous (seed retaining) cones in young jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) was due to environmental causes, particularly to ground-radiated heat, or to the juvenility of the trees. Twenty-five jack pine populations were sampled in the southern part of the boreal forest, in Abitibi, Quebec. The age, diameter at breast height (DBH), and number of serotinous and nonserotinous cones per branch were determined for 30 trees per population. A subset of 10 other trees per population was felled to determine the number of serotinous and nonserotinous cones per cone age-class and per branch. DBH, age, and height of these trees were also measured. The results showed that DBH is more strongly related than age or height to the appearance of the first serotinous cone. Most trees that did not bear any serotinous cones had not reached a DBH of 7 cm. Until individuals had reached a DBH of 10 cm, die proportion of serotinous cones increased from year to year. The proportion of serotinous cones greater-than-or-equal-to 4 years old was significantly lower than that of younger cones, indicating that old cones tended to open, particularly on those trees with a DBH greater than 10 cm. The proportion of serotinous cones on branches below 260 cm was significantly lower than that of cones situated above that height. The same trends were observed for cones where serotiny was determined in the laboratory, suggesting that the thermal environment is not entirely responsible for serotinous cone opening. We suggest that the age of branches affects the opening of cones and that the absence of serotinous cones in small trees is related to their juvenility. Seed release resulting from the absence of serotiny in small jack pine trees and the opening observed in old cones may play an important role in serotinous populations when the time interval between two fires is longer than the life-span of one jack pine generation.},

  Abstract                 = {To assess the effects of site type, forest initiation periods and fire regimes on the dynamics of Pinus banksiana (Jack pine), the age structure of 69 populations of the species was analyzed. Two landscapes with different fire regimes were selected in the southern part of the Canadian boreal forest in Quebec: the 'mainland landscape' is characterized by a fire regime of large lethal fires, the 'island landscape' is affected by a complex fire regime including lethal and non-lethal fires. Age structure was compared between forest initiation periods and site types (mesic mainland, xeric mainland and xeric island) using the Shannon regularity index. An even-aged population structure was found within the first 100 yr following a lethal fire, while after that period the population structure becomes more uneven-aged. Under mesic conditions, populations tend to have an even-aged structure, under xeric conditions an uneven-aged structure. Natural openings present in xeric sites allow for recruitment in the absence of fire. This permits the self-maintenance of Pinus banksiana. Xeric island populations show more uneven-aged structures than xeric mainland populations. The occurrence of non-lethal fires on the islands creates uneven-aged structures. Further, the results suggest that the selection pressure of the island fire regime, favouring non-serotinous and mixed P. banksiana individuals, is one of the factors responsible for a higher recruitment in the absence of fire on islands than on the mainland.},

  Abstract                 = {To determine the effects of insularity on the genetic structure and variability of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) populations at a regional scale, stands from two different landscapes were studied: two islands in a lake and two mainland areas. The two landscapes have been affected by different fire regimes. The genetic structure and variability of the four populations were analyzed using cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis of 11 enzyme systems. The analysis of 22 loci showed an average polymorphism of 60.0\%, a mean of 2.3 alleles per locus, a mean of 1.185 effective alleles per locus, and an observed level of heterozygosity of 0.171. The F(is) values (i.e., fixation index of individuals relative to their population) for all but two loci indicated an excess of heterozygotes compared with the expected numbers under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The genetic differentiation among populations was weak (F(st) = 0.018). There were no significant differences among the four populations for five genetic parameters (mean number of alleles per locus, mean number of effective alleles per locus, percentage of polymorphic loci, and observed or expected heterozygosity). Although the allelic frequencies were homogeneous between island populations, a significant heterogeneity in allele frequencies was observed between mainland populations. The results suggest that gene flow in island populations is sufficiently high to maintain a level of genetic variability similar to that found in mainland populations and to counteract the effect of isolation and differential selective pressures resulting from different disturbance regimes.},

  Abstract                 = {Ponderosa pine plant community and forest structure were compared among three stands in Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona: one stand had 120 years of artificial fire exclusion (NOBURN) and the other two nearby stands had been frequently burned (BURN-E and BURN-W). These forests are valuable places to gauge anthropogenic changes associated with European settlement, due to their land history of limited livestock grazing and no logging. Precipitation varied greatly between sampling years (260 mm in 2000, 505 mm in 2001). Tree density was significantly higher at NOBURN (1424 trees ha(-1)) with significantly higher rotten coarse woody debris (23.2 Mg ha(-1)) and duff depth (4.3 cm) than at the burned sites, as expected in the absence of fire. Although species richness was not significantly different among sites (48-89 species), richness differed significantly by year. Shannon's index of diversity increased by approximately 10% from the dry year to the wet year on all sites. Community composition and plant cover at NOBURN differed significantly from the two burned sites in both years in non-metric multidimensional scaling ordinations. Increasing duff depth was related to decreased plant cover. Two of the three dominant species were different at the fire-excluded site compared to the burned sites. We conclude that although plant community structure was related to fire history, environmental stress and within-stand variability were also important drivers. We suggest selecting reference sites in close proximity to the site to be restored and using a multi-scale, multi-year, multi-site approach to measure reference conditions in ponderosa pine.},

Of particular interest is the role of population size on genetic draft. Remarkably, the rate of substitution of weakly selected advantageous mutations decreases with increasing population size, whereas that for deleterious mutations increases with population size. This dependency on population size is the opposite of that for genetic drift. Moreover, these rates are only weakly dependent on population size, again contrary to the strong dependency of drift-based dynamics, Four models of the strongly selected loci responsible for genetic draft are examined, Three of these exhibit a very weak dependency on population size, which implies that their induced effects will also be weakly dependent on population size. Together, these results suggest that population size and binomial sampling may not be relevant to a species' evolution. If this is the case, then a number of evolutionary conundrums are resolved.},

The pseudohitchhiking model is a one-locus model that approximates these effects and can be used to describe the major consequences of linked selection. As the changes in neutral allele frequencies when hitchhiking are rapid, diffusion theory is not appropriate for studying neutral dynamics. A stationary distribution and some results on substitution processes are presented that use the theory of continuos-time Markuv processes with discontinuous sample paths. The coalescent of the pseudohitchhiking model is shown to have a random number of branches at each node, which leads to a frequency spectrum that is different from that of the equilibrium neutral model. If genetic draft, the name given to these induced stochastic effects, is a more important stochastic force than genetic drift, then a number of paradoxes that have plagued population genetics disappear.},

  Abstract                 = {Tests of adaptive explanations are often critically confounded by phylogenetic heritage. In this paper we propose statistics and a null model for estimating phylogenetic effects in comparative data. We apply a model-independent measure of autocorrelation (Moran's I) for estimating whether cross-taxonomic trait variation is related to phylogeny. We develop a phylogenetic correlogram for assessing how autocorrelation varies with patristic distance and for judging the appropriateness and effectiveness of an autoregressive model. We then revise Cheverud et al.'s (1985, Evolution, 39:1335-1351) autocorrelational model to incorporate greater flexibility in the relation between trait variation and phylogenetic distance. Finally, we analyze various comparative data sets (body weight incarnivores, clutch size in birds) and phylogenies (morphological, molecular) to illustrate some of the complications that may arise from using an autoregressive model and to explore the effects of different weighting matrices in adjusting for these complications. Although our approach has limitations, it is both effective in partitioning trait variation into adaptive and phylogenetic components and flexible in adjusting to perculiarities in taxonomic distribution.},

  Abstract                 = {Frequent, low intensity fire was an important component of the natural disturbance regime of presettlement savannas and woodlands in the southeastern USAdominated by longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), and prescribed burning is now a critical part of the management of these endangered habitats. Fire season,fire frequency, and fire intensity are three potentially important, though still little understood, components of both natural and managed fire regimes. In thislong-term (8-yr) study, we experimentally (through the use of prescribed burning) tested for effects of fire season (eight different times throughout the year)and fire frequency (annual vs. biennial burning), on population dynamics (recruitment, growth, mortality, change in density, and change in basal area [the totalbasal area of all stems in a plot]) and species composition of trees in two quite different types of longleaf-pine-dominated habitats (north Florida sandhills andflatwoods). Limited fire temperature and intensity data were also collected during one year to examine the relationship between fire behavior (temperature andintensity) and tree mortality. Contrary to prior hypotheses, our results showed few systematic or predictable effects of season or frequency of burning ondynamics of longleaf pine. Instead, variability in the population dynamics of this species appeared to be related largely to variation in fire behavior, regardlessof the season of burning. Consistent with prior hypotheses, we found that deciduous oak species (Quercus laevis, e. margaretta, and Q. incana) were leastvulnerable to dormant-season burning and most vulnerable to burning early in the growing season. This was shown particularly by seasonal trends in the effectof burning on oak mortality (both topkill and complete kill) and, to a lesser extent, on oak recruitment. Oak densities and basal areas also declined in thespring-burned plots, resulting in a shift away from oaks and towards increased dominance by longleaf pine. Detrimental effects of spring burning on oaks werepartly explained by fire behavior, but there appeared also to be an important residual effect of burning season, particularly on complete kill. Though longleafpine population dynamics did not differ markedly as a result of burning season and frequency, we did find important differences in pine dynamics between thetwo habitats (i.e., sandhills and flatwoods). In general, populations of longleaf pines in the sandhills appeared to be density regulated, while flatwoods pinepopulations were declining regardless of the level of intraspecific competition. This suggests that long-term persistence of longleaf pine, and perhaps otherfire-adapted species in frequently burned longleaf-pine-dominated communities, may be determined by complex interactions between habitat factors and fireregimes.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine the effects of density dependence and immigration on local adaptation in a ''black-hole sink'' habitat, i.e., a habitat in which isolated populations of a species would tend to extinction but where a population is demographically maintained by recurrent one-way migration from a separate source habitat in which the species persists. Using a diploid, one-locus model of a discrete-generation sink population maintained by immigration from a fixed source population, we show that a locally favored allele will spread when rare in the sink if the absolute fitness (or, in some cases, the geometric-mean absolute fitness) of heterozygotes with the favored allele is above one in the sink habitat. With density dependence, the criterion for spread can depend on the rate of immigration, because immigration affects local densities and, hence, absolute fitness. Given the successful establishment of a locally favored allele, it will be maintained by a migration-selection balance and the resulting polymorphic population will be sustained deterministically with either stable or unstable dynamics. The densities of stable polymorphic populations tend to exceed densities that would be maintained in the absence of the favored allele. With strong density regulation, spread of the favored allele may destabilize population dynamics. Our analyses show that polymorphic populations which form subsequent to the establishment of favorable alleles have the capacity to persist deterministically without immigration. Finally, we examined the probabilistic rate at which new favored alleles arise and become established in a sink population. Our results suggest that favored alleles are established most readily at intermediate levels of immigration, (C) 1999 Academic Press.},

We use a haploid matching-alleles model for coevolution to evaluate how a pair of species coevolves when fitness interactions are reciprocal in some locations (''hot spots'') but not in others (''cold spots''). Our analyses consider mutualistic and antagonistic interspecific interactions and a variety of gene Dow patterns between hot and cold spots. We found that hot and cold spots together with gene flow influence coevolutionary dynamics in four important ways. First, hot spots need not be ubiquitous to have a global influence on evolution, although rare hat spots wilt not have a disproportionate impact unless selection is relatively strong there. Second, asymmetries in gene flow can influence local adaptation, sometimes creating stable equilibria at which species experience minimal fitness in hot spots and maximal fitness in cold spots, or vice versa. Third, asymmetries in gene flow are no more important than asymmetries in population regulation for determining the maintenance of local polymorphisms through coevolution. Fourth, intraspecific allele frequency differences among hot and cold spot populations evolve under some, but not all, conditions. That is, selection mosaics are indeed capable of producing spatially variable coevolutionary outcomes across the landscapes over which species interact. Altogether, our analyses indicate that coevolutionary trajectories can be strongly shaped by the geographic distribution of coevolutionary hot and cold spots, and by the pattern of gene flow among populations.},

In the populations assayed 127 allelic variants at 25 loci were revealed. NEI's distance coefficient (Dn) was used to estimate the level of genetic differentiation among P. sylvestris races and among closely related species. A dendrogram constructed using Dn values shows that of the five P. sylvestris races analyzed only the geographically isolated var. hamata exhibited sufficient differences at the Dia-2 locus (a mean Dn value relative to the other four races is 0.025) to recognize it as a distinct taxon. The remaining races, "sylvestris", "cretacea", "lapponica", and "sibirica", have a similar gene pool (Dn values are not greater than 0.010), and they should be regarded as a single taxon, P. sylvestris var. sylvestris. Interspecific comparisons revealed that P. sylvestris and P. mugo have the closest genetic affinities to each other with NEI'S genetic distance of 0. 108. The dendrogram demonstrates that P. funebris is closer to P. sylvestris and P. mugo than P. pallasiana. The available paleontologic data allowed us to conclude that NEI'S (1975) time scale estimate for the time of divergence of the taxa was more accurate than NEI'S (1971) time scale estimate.},

The data also show that P. cretacea, which occurs on ancient carbonate rock outcrops, can be regarded simply as a race of P. sylvestris. On the whole, our results demonstrate that sufficient genetic variation exists in P. sylvestris to explain its great ecological plasticity and evolutionary potential.

  Abstract                 = {Plants are able to shed organs that are diseased, stressed or at the terminal stage of their development. Shedding takes place at a morphologically distinct site, the abscission zone, in a process that is accelerated by ethylene and retarded by auxin. Associated with cell separation is an increase in the expression of a spectrum of gene products, including hydrolytic enzymes and peptides that protect the exposed fracture surface from pathogenic attack, Key research objectives are the identification of abscission-specific gene promoters and the elucidation of the morphogenetic events that regulate cell differentiation in the abscission zone, Manipulation of both the site and rate of shedding will then become feasible.},

  Abstract                 = {The first 2 years of post-bum vegetation succession of 11-13-year-old rehabilitated bauxite mines in Western Australia is compared to the native jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest using the techniques of ordination (CANOCO (TM)) and classification (TWINSPAN (TM)). Analyses of understorey species density and cover values showed consistent patterns of composition and abundance between the native jar;ah forest and the rehabilitated areas, both before and after burning. These patterns resulted from the intentional establishment of high densities of legume species in the initial rehabilitation process and proliferation of high densities of seeding species and non-native eucalypt seedlings following burning of the rehabilitated areas, features not characteristic of native jarrah forest. Burnt sites showed larger changes in species abundance and composition than unburnt control sites as indicated by their relative shift of position in the ordination hyper-space. This shift in position was generally less for sites burnt in spring than sites burnt in autumn. The first two divisions of the site classifications separated the unburnt sites and early spring post-burn sites from the forest and the remainder of the post-burn sites. The species classification showed that each of these groups was associated with a specific suite of species. Pit age (i.e. 11, 12 or 13 years-old at time of burning) was an important determinant of species composition in both the ordinations and classifications. Although species densities recovered more rapidly than live plant cover in the rehabilitated areas following burning, the vegetation of these rehabilitated sites exhibited little evidence of returning to their pre-tire species composition and abundance after 2 years. However, the high species similarity (75-79%) between the pre-burn (including species only present as sled in the topsoil) and post-bum vegetation indicates the importance of the initial floristic composition in determining the potential direction of the post-fire succession.

  Abstract                 = {A range of forest management treatments was applied to ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) in northern Arizona. The treatments represented the full range of existing stand disturbance conditions and included forest stands that were unmanaged, thinned, thinned and prescribed burned, and burned by stand-replacing wildfire in order of increasing disturbance intensity. We assessed differences in understory diversity associated with these treatments. We identified 195 species of understory plants. focusing on the distribution of natives and exotics. The abundance of understory plants was more sensitive to changes in management treatments than the overall species richness. Exotics on the whole, responded statistically more strongly to disturbance treatments than did natives. Both the richness and abundance of exotic forbs increased significantly with treatment intensity. Species richness remained stable while abundance of native graminoids increased significantly with treatment intensity through thinned and burned stands. Both then decreased significantly in stands that experienced wildfire. The number of native shrub species decreased significantly with treatment intensity. Overall plant diversity was least in the unmanaged stands and progressively increased with intensity of disturbance/stand treatments. Both prescribed burning and wildfire increased plant diversity; however, stand-replacing wildfire also appeared to substantially increase the diversity of exotic plants.

  Abstract                 = {Fire can cause severe nitrogen (N) losses from grassland, chaparral, and temperate and boreal forest ecosystems. Paradoxically, soil ammonium levels are markedly increased by fire, resulting in high rates of primary production in re-establishing plant communities. In a manipulative experiment, we examined the influence of wild-fire ash residues on soil, microbial and plant N pools in a recently burned Californian bishop pine (Pinus muricata D. Don) forest. Ash stimulated post-fire primary production and ecosystem N retention through direct N inputs from ash to soils, as well as indirect ash effects on soil N availability to plants. These results suggest that redistribution of surface ash after fire by wind or water may cause substantial heterogeneity in soil N availability to plants? and could be an important mechanism contributing to vegetation patchiness in fire-prone ecosystems. In addition, we investigated the impact of fire on ecosystem N cycling by comparing N-15 natural abundance values from recently burned and nearby unburned P. muricata forest communities. At the burned site, N-15 natural abundance in recolonising species was similar to that in bulk soil organic matter. By contrast, there was a marked N-15 depletion in the same species relative to the total soil N pool at the unburned site. These results suggest that plant uptake of nitrate (which tends to be strongly depleted in N-15 because of fractionation during nitrification) is low in recently burned forest communities but could be an important component of ecosystem N cycling in mature conifer stands.},

  Abstract                 = {Sprouting vigour is determined by the plant amount of reserves and intrinsic growth rate of plants. While the first factor has been well studied, the second is far less understood. Although a higher growth rate would imply a higher sprouting vigour, fast-growing species may have less below-ground reserves, and thus, a lower sprouting potential. The relative importance of both opposite effects was little explored in the literature. To analyse the influence of growth rate on sprouting vigour, one growth season after a fire we measured plant height of the old (pre-fire) and new (post-fire) tissue in 194 individuals of 14 woody species from a woodland in central Argentina. We calculated a mean value of pre- and post-fire height for each species, and obtained from a data-base potential height at maturity, wood density (WD) and specific leaf area (SLA), as surrogates of intrinsic growth rate. We performed a forward stepwise multiple regression using WD and SLA, together with mean pre-fire height or potential height as independent variables, and mean post-fire height (as an indicator of resprout vigour) as the dependent variable. Interactions were also tested. Pre-fire height, WD and their interaction term were the variables that best explained post-fire height. We also analysed the relationship between pre- and post-fire size for each species independently by fitting hyperbolic functions. Then we correlated both parameters of the functions to species characteristics (WD, SLA, potential height and mean pre-fire height). Both parameters of the hyperbolic functions were significantly correlated only with WD, but not with the other species characteristics. All results together indicate that species with low WD (i.e. high potential growth rate) regrow more vigorously than species with high WD when pre-fire individuals were tall. In contrast, when pre-fire individuals were small, WD had no influence on sprout vigour. A trade-off between allocation of biomass to underground reserves and shoot growth seems to be responsible for the patterns obtained. For small individuals, below-ground reserves seem to play a more important role than inherent growth rate (here measured through WD) in determining the sprouting vigour, while for large individuals, growth rate seems more important than reserves.},

The marked effects on organisms are of increasing interest for ecological prediction, given the natural and anthropogenic changes in spectra of extreme events being induced by global change. Yet there is currently a paucity of knowledge or even a common world-view of how extreme events shape individuals, communities and We propose that extreme events need be defined in terms of organisecosystems. mal responses of acclimation and of de-acclimation or hysteresis. From this definition we proceed to develop a number of hypotheses, including that fitness effects of extreme events occur primarily during recovery. We review evidence that, on the evolutionary time scale, selection is, virtually absent except during extreme events; these drive strong directional selection, even to trait fixation and speciation. We describe a number of new tools, both conceptual and technological, that are now at hand or that merit rapid development.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the possibility of coexistence of pure, inherited strategies belonging to a large set of potential strategies. We prove that under biologically relevant conditions every model allowing for coexistence of infinitely many strategies is structurally unstable. In particular, this is the case when the "interaction operator" which determines how the growth rate of a strategy depends on the strategy distribution of the population is compact. The interaction operator is not assumed to be linear. We investigate a Lotka-Volterra competition model with a linear interaction operator of convolution type separately because the convolution operator is not compact. For this model, we exclude the possibility of robust coexistence supported on the whole real line, or even on a set containing a limit point. Moreover, we exclude coexistence of an infinite set of equidistant strategies when the total population size is finite. On the other hand, for infinite populations it is possible to have robust coexistence in this case. These results are in line with the ecological concept of "limiting similarity" of coexisting species. We conclude that the mathematical structure of the ecological coexistence problem itself dictates the discreteness of the species.},

The more drought-tolerant the plant, the more negative the xylem pressure can become without cavitation, and the greater the internal load on the xylem conduit walls. Accordingly, D-t was correlated with cavitation resistance. This trend was consistent with the maintenance of a safety factor from implosion by negative pressure: conduit wall span (b) and thickness (t) scaled so that (t/b)(2) was proportional to cavitation resistance as required to avoid wall collapse. Unexpectedly, trends in D-t may be as much or more related to support of the xylem pipeline as to support of the plant.},

  Abstract                 = {If constantly changing genotypes are favorable in host and parasite coevolution, an indefinite escalation of mutation rates would result despite heavy mutational loads. We theoretically study this possibility by examining the mutation modifier dynamics of host and parasite that engage in genotype-specific epidemiological interaction. In the first model, we study the evolutionarily stable (ESS) mutation rate or switching rate if two alleles in a single locus are subjected to frequency-dependent selection favoring the rarer of the two. Mutation modifier locus is either tightly linked or unlinked to the selected locus. Sufficiently strong frequency-dependent selection may cause cycles in allele frequencies, and a modifier with higher mutation rate enjoys the long-term advantage by randomizing the genotype of their offspring. Through the repeated events of invasion and replacement of mutation modifiers, the mutation rate continues to increase until the allele frequencies are stabilized. If some fraction of mutations are deleterious, there is no longer a pure ESS mutation rate: the evolutionarily stable population then consists of multiple strains concerning mutation modifier, typically one with a very high mutation rate and the other with a very low rate, stably coexisting and fighting off invasions by any other modifiers. These results are almost independent of the linkage between the selected and the modifier loci. In the second model, we consider the joint evolution of host and parasite mutation modifiers, assuming that a specific pair of host and parasite genotype densities change following the Nicholson-Bailey type model. If there is no cost of deleterious mutations, mutation rates of both species are escalated indefinitely by modifier evolution until they completely suppress the fluctuation of genotype densities. However, a small cost of deleterious mutation is enough to collapse this coevolutionary equilibrium of inflated mutations. Typical coevolutionary outcome is that the parasite mutation rate is accelerated to a high level; whereas the host mutation rate is driven to zero. Extension of our results to host-parasite coevolution of recombination modifier evolution is discussed. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited},

  Abstract                 = {Ceanothus comprises similar to 55 morphologically and ecologically diverse species of woody perennials endemic to North America. Interpretations of the natural history of Ceanothus have served as a general model of evolution for woody perennials with simple entomophilous pollination systems, but these interpretations lacked explicit phylogenetic context. We used cladistic analysis of sequences of the chloroplast-encoded matK and the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and 5.85 coding region of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) to reconstruct the phylogeny of Ceanothus. The nuclear and organellar phylogenies exhibited very low levels of both topological and character conference. Subgenera Ceanothus and Cerastes are monophyletic sister taxa in both phylogenies, but both data sets suffer from a lack of resolution below the level of subgenus. Lack of taxonomic congruence between the two data sets may be a result of introgression and/or lineage sorting. The ITS tree was accepted as the better estimate of a species phylogeny for Ceanothus, on the assumption that nuclear markers are less prone to introgression. Three of five polytypic species in the ITS data set were paraphyletic, and four of six polytypic species in the matK data set were paraphyletic. This study demonstrates the degree to which matched independent data sets can produce conflicting summaries of evolutionary history.},

The structure of the dominant overstory was inferred from the size and spatial patterning of stumps, logs, snags, and live trees (greater than 140 years of age) within 48 0.5 ha plots. Size class distributions, basal area, and spatial distribution of historical trees were compared among plant association groups representing a range of environmental conditions. Using spatial point pattern analysis, we found that significant clumping at fine scales (0-15 m) existed historically. Spatial patterning of present day and historical trees of four comparable plots suggests that while strong clumping exists in present day stands, the largest trees today exhibit less clumping than did large historical trees. Historical SDI (260) for dominant overstories was nearly the same as threshold for serious beetle mortality (263) for ponderosa pine. Cut-tree marking was carried out within 15 m radius circles, as guided by the spatial patterning analysis, and using a sliding scale of trees per circle by quadratic mean diameter. },

Because the abundance distribution is derived under the condition of self-similarity, it:may be widely applicable beyond ecology.},

  Abstract                 = {We explore empirical and theoretical evidence for the functional significance of plant-litter diversity and the extraordinary high diversity of decomposer organisms in the process of litter decomposition and the consequences for biogeochemical cycles. Potential mechanisms for the frequently observed litter- diversity effects on mass loss and nitrogen dynamics include fungi-driven nutrient transfer among litter species, inhibition or stimulation of microorganisms by specific litter compounds, and positive feedback of soil fauna due to greater habitat and food diversity. Theory predicts positive effects of microbial diversity that result from functional niche complementarity, but the few existing experiments provide conflicting results. Microbial succession with shifting enzymatic capabilities enhances decomposition, whereas antagonistic interactions among fungi that compete for similar resources slow litter decay. Soil-fauna diversity manipulations indicate that the number of trophic levels, species identity, and the presence of keystone species have a strong impact on decomposition, whereas the importance of diversity within functional groups is not clear at present. In conclusion, litter species and decomposer diversity can significantly influence carbon and nutrient turnover rates; however, no general or predictable pattern has emerged. Proposed mechanisms for diversity effects need confirmation and a link to functional traits for a comprehensive understanding of how biodiversity interacts with decomposition processes and the consequences of ongoing biodiversity loss for ecosystem functioning.},

  Abstract                 = {Historical evidence of recurrent fire in many of the world’s biomes suggests that fire may have had profound evolutionary influences on their extant floras. However, the role of fire as a selective force in the origin and evolution of plant traits remains controversial. Using Bayesian Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain procedures and calibration points from the fossil record, we generated a dated phylogeny for the iconic Australian genus Banksia, and reconstructed the evolutionary/chronological position of five putatively fire-related traits. The fire-dependent trait, on-plant seed storage (serotiny), and associated fire-enhancing trait, dead floret retention, co-originated with the first appearance of Banksia 60.8 million yr ago (Palaeocene). Whether nonsprouting or resprouting is ancestral was indeterminable, but the first banksias were nonclonal. Derived traits, such as dead leaf retention (fire-enhancing) and clonality (underground budbanks; fire-avoiding), first appeared 26–16 million yr ago (Miocene) with the onset of seasonal drought and thus more frequent fire, and culminated in dead florets/bracts completely covering the persistent fruits in some species. Thus, fire may have been a selective force in the very origin of Banksia 40 million yr before the onset of climate seasonality in the Miocene, and continued to have an impact on the direction of evolution, favouring traits consistent with adaptation to an increasingly (sometimes less) fire-prone environment.},

  Abstract                 = {It is argued that the resistance of non-host plants to plant parasitic fungi is the result of parasite-non-specific basic resistance rather than the consequence of specific recognition of each fungal parasite. In crop plants, and probably wild plant species, this basic resistance in maintained by a mixture of passive and active defenses that exhibit inter-, and possibly intra-, specific differences. Many, if not all, of the components of basic resistance not only defend the plant against stresses in addition to those exerted by plant parasitic fungi, but also have other roles in plant structure and function. Therefore, these components may be subject to random effects and multiple selection pressures of which fungal parasitism may be a minor component. Nevertheless, the coupling of the recognition of fungal products or activities with the inducible components of basic resistance seems to have occurred early in plant evolution, although not necessarily in response to selective pressures exerted by ancient fungi. It is suggested that in natural ecosystems, parasite-specific resistance should have no selective advantage until the fungus has established sufficient basic compatibility (by means of specific pathogenicity factors) with its host species that the plant's fitness is reduced. This resistance may not necessarily be the result of 'gene-for-gene' interactions, and may be difficult to distinguish from pathovar-specific, 'residual' basic resistance resulting from fungal genotypes differing in their complement of pathogenicity factors such that each one is able to completely overcome the basic resistance of only some genotypes of the host. Superimposed on any co-evolutionary changes in plant and fungus are longer-term changes in basic resistance that may eventually change a susceptible host into a non-host if the fungus cannot produce the necessary new or modified pathogenicity factors. Major determinants of the evolutionary paths followed by any interacting plant and fungus are the actual mechanisms of plant resistance and fungal pathogenicity or virulence. Therefore, the complex web of interactions that exists today reflects the evolutionary path that each organism has followed as well as more recent selective pressures on the interactions themselves.},

  Abstract                 = {Changes in vegetation composition after fire in a Sarcopoterium spinosum dwarf-shrub community on phosphorus-deficient terra rossa soil overlying limestone were studied over a 10-yr period. Herbicide application and phosphate fertilizer were combined to provide a range of initial conditions for recovery. The site was undisturbed during the growing season in winter but was grazed by cattle in summer. Encroachment rate of S. spinosum was mainly a function of the density of viable buds on plants that survived the fire and/or the shrub control treatments. This, together with the very low rate of shrub establishment from seed set a short-to-medium term limit to the attainable cover of S. spinosum. The leguminous shrub Calycotome villosa appeared only in the third year after the fire, apparently from seed. After shrub control, the encroachment rate of C. villosa was low, even after 9 yr. On the other hand, where no herbicide was applied, and with the cessation of goat grazing, C. villosa became increasingly prominent, to the extent that by the 8th year after the fire, it inhibited the continued expansion of S. spinosum. Phosphorus nutrition tended to reduce the cover of S. spinosum because of its stimulating effect on the predominantly leguminous herbaceous vegetation. C. villosa also appeared to benefit from greater phosphorus availability, despite greater competition from the annual vegetation. These findings show that, depending on the context, secondary succession after fire can take different courses. Whereas the combined effect of herbicide control and P-enrichment cannot prevent shrub encroachment, it can slow down the rate of succession for more than a decade, despite the presence of ample shrub seed sources in the area.},

  Abstract                 = {Resources for prescribed fire are frequently insufficient to manage public lands for all conservation and resource management objectives, necessitating prioritization of the application of fire across the landscape within any given year. Defining tradeoffs when applying prescribed fire to large landscapes is problematic not only because of the complexity of weighing competing management objectives at the landscape scale, but also because of the difficult nature of independently applying need-to-burn criteria to large areas. We present a case study of a simple modeling process implemented at Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle (U. S. A.) to prioritize the application of prescribed fire. In a workshop setting, managers and biologists identified key conservation criteria and landscape management objectives that drive the application of prescribed fire. Remote sensing and other spatial data were developed to directly or indirectly represent all these criteria. Using geographic information system software, managers and biologists weighted each criterion according to its relative contribution to overall burn prioritization, and individual values for the criterion were scored according to how they influence the need to burn. Subsequently, this process has been validated and modified through ecological monitoring. This modeling process has also been applied to the 77,400-ha Blackwater River State Forest, public land adjacent to Eglin Air Force Base, demonstrating its applicability to lands with varying management priorities. The advantages of this model-based approach for prioritizing prescribed fire include the reliance on accessible, inexpensive software, the development of spatially explicit management objectives, the ease of transferability, and clearly stated assumptions about management that may be tested and reviewed through monitoring and public comment.},

  Abstract                 = {The sprouting success of co-occurring populations of shrub species in a temperate woodland of semi-arid Australia was investigated and related to population survival strategies. Straw was added to 21 x 15 m plots in the woodland, burnt and the pre-fire characteristics of shrubs were used to determine the basis for sprouting success. Species differed widely (4-94%) in sprouting success; a high percentage of established seedlings of all species were killed by lire but survival increased with height reaching a maximum at 25-60 cm (depending on the species). Thickness of bark at stem bases increased with height growth but sprouting success was not related to bark thickness; sprouting success of shrubs at similar thickness varied greatly between species. All species were able to initiate sprouts after cutting through their basal stems, so lack of active meristems was not a limitation. Species differed in the height at which shrubs began flowering but this was always after maximum sprouting success was reached. It is proposed that differences between individual shrubs in supply of nutrients, carbohydrates, and/or water to activated meristems would account for patterns of inter- and intra-specific sprouting success. The data are consistent with recognised fin survival strategies. 'Sprouters', the species relying more on sprouting than recruitment for population persistence, maintained maximum sprouting success with height growth and gained sprouting ability along stems once they reached Im in height. In contrast, 'non-sprouters', the species largely relying on recruitment from seed to maintain populations, were either not able to sprout after seedling establishment or steadily lost the ability to maintain sprouts with growth beyond 60 cm and did not develop axillary buds along stems at any height.},

  Abstract                 = {South African fynbos ecosystems are under threat from alien plant invasions and transformations to alternative land uses. If large-scale habitat loss and species extinction are to be halted, restoration actions are urgently required. We postulate that by adopting an approach in which an understanding of community and ecosystem dynamics is applied to restoration practices, protocols can be developed which will lead to more efficient restoration. This understanding is based on a review of the relevant ecological literature, focusing on recruitment dynamics, community structure, and ecosystem function, which are particularly relevant to restoration. We develop a conceptual framework for restoration and apply our protocols to a case study area on the Cape Peninsula. Before ecological restoration can begin, the cause of transformation must first be removed or ameliorated. The next step is to ensure that the important ecological processes are functioning. We contend that a fully functioning community requires a good balance of the major growth-form, regeneration, and nutrient acquisition guilds. Fire is the natural disturbance event initiating recruitment in fynbos. It is, therefore, essential to either bunt a site or provide fire-related germination cues in order to stimulate recruitment. Where guilds are under-represented, corrective reintroductions will further improve the long-term resilience of the restored community. Many taxa have persistent soil-stored seed banks, so it is important to conserve topsoil and optimize use of this local species pool. Seed dispersal distances are generally very short, and in highly transformed sites it will be necessary to reintroduce seed of the major guilds in order to restore community structure and functioning. Post-fire succession in fynbos begins with the full complement of species; species gradually die out from the vegetation according to their respective life spans. In order to stimulate germination and promote successful establishment, it is important to sow seed after fire or site clearing in late summer or autumn. Introducing seed or plants at a later stage in the succession is very likely to fail. Because of the localized distributions of many taxa, extreme care must be taken when selecting species for reintroduction if local gene pools are to be conserved.},

  Abstract                 = {The evolution of adaptive behaviours can influence population dynamics. Conversely, population dynamics can affect both the rate and direction of adaptive evolution. This paper examines reasons why sink populations - populations maintained by immigration, preventing local extinction - might persist in the habitat repertoire of a species over evolutionary time-scales. Two such reasons correspond to standard explanations for deviations from an ideal free habitat distribution: organisms may not be free to settle in whichever habitat has the highest potential fitness, and may be constrained by costs, perceptual limitations, or mode of dispersal in the acuity of their habitat selectivity. Here, I argue that a third general reason for persistent sink populations is provided by unstable population dynamics in source habitats. I present a simple model illustrating how use of a sink habitat may be selectively advantageous, when a source population has unstable dynamics (which necessarily reflects temporal variation in local fitnesses). Species with unstable local dynamics in high-quality habitats should be selected to utilize a broader range of habitats than species with stable local dynamics, and in particular in some circumstances should utilize sink habitats. This observation has implications for the direction of niche evolution, and the likelihood of niche conservatism.},

  Abstract                 = {The most basic adaptation of a species is its ecological niche - that set of environmental conditions, resources, etc. which permit its populations to persist without immigration. Immigration from habitats with conditions within the niche (''source'' populations) can sustain populations in habitats outside the niche (''sink'' populations). Recent theoretical work on adaptive evolution in source-sink environments suggests that niche evolution should often be conservative, favoring the improvement or maintenance of adaptation to sources, at the expense of improved adaptation in sinks. Niche conservatism requires sinks to remain sinks over evolutionary time-scales. This paper uses models of coupled population and evolutionary dynamics in a spatially heterogeneous environment to examine the effect of density-dependence on niche conservatism and evolution. Density-dependence in birth, death, or dispersal rates can influence the relative evolutionary importance of source and sink habitats. Three distinct dispersal modes are compared. Species with density-dependent, ideal-free dispersal should exhibit niche conservatism. Species with passive or density-independent dispersal are more likely to show niche evolution, but only if rates of dispersal are sufficiently high and fitness in the sink is not too low. Species with active interference leading to a non-ideal free habitat distribution should be expected to be evolutionarily labile in their ecological niches.

Don; and Monterey pine: Pinus radiata D. Don. Genomic DNA from 384 trees representing 19 populations were digested with 9-20 restriction enzymes and probed with cloned cpDNA fragments from Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) France] that comprise 82% of the chloroplast genome. Up to 313 restriction sites were surveyed, and 25 of these were observed to be polymorphic among or within species. Differences among species accounted for the majority of genetic (haplotypic) diversity observed [G(ST) = 84(+/-13)%]; nucleotide diversity among species was, estimated to be 0.3(+/- 0.1)%. Knobcone pine and Monterey pine displayed almost no genetic variation within or among populations. Bishop pine also showed little variability within populations, but did display strong population differences [G(st) = 87(+/-8)%] that were a result of three distinct geographic groups. Mean nucleotide diversity within populations was 0.003(+/-0.002)%; intrapopulation polymorphisms were found in only five populations. This pattern of genetic variation contrasts strongly with findings from study of nuclear genes (allozymes) in the group, where most genetic diversity resides within populations rather than among populations or species. Regions of the genome subject to frequent length mutations were identified; estimates of subdivision based on length variant frequencies in one region differed strikingly from those based on site mutations or allozymes. Two trees were identified with a major chloroplast DNA inversion that closely resembled one documented between Pinus and Pseudotsuga.},

  Abstract                 = {We develop a theory of competition based on two mechanisms that we call the cost of rarity (Mechanism R) and the cost of commonness (Mechanism C). These reduce the rate of population increase only at high densities (asexual organisms) or both at high and low densities (sexual species). The theory predicts that, in certain circumstances, the number of coexisting species in any assemblage will be finite and that these species will differ in their utilization of resources (and in associated morphological traits) more than expected by chance. Specifically, it predicts such nonrandom assortment in assemblages of three or more (i.e. multispecies) sexual species, especially in those communities where a few species are numerically dominant, but not in two-species associations and not in asexual forms. Unlike other theories, however, ours does not predict any specific value of morphological ratio or limiting similarity. We develop procedures to assess the degree of numerical dominance in an assemblage, and then test the predictions of the theory using data on morphological size ratios. The tests yield results that are consistent with the theory. Our analysis of multispecies assemblages Of granivorous rodents, bird-eating hawks, Anolis and sexual Cnemidophorus lizards, show that in these assemblages very small ratios are observed less often than expected by chance. Coexisting asexual Cnemidophorus lizards tend to be extremely similar in size. Nesting sparrow and flycatcher assemblages exhibit low numerical dominance which we predict will inhibit detection of regular assortment, and we find no regular pattern in these assemblages. Finally, we fail to detect regular assortment in most two-species associations as expected. We examine several alternative mechanisms that might account for morphological segregation among coexisting species but find little evidence that they have been important.},

  Abstract                 = {Controlled ground fires had a significant effect on survival and growth of 1- to 2-year-old seedlings of Acer rubrum, Quercus rubra and Quercus alba. In addition, although not statistically significant, seedling survival of fire was higher at lower than at higher fuel loading levels. Seedlings of Q. rubra survived fire better than those of A. rubrum. This superior survival was associated with a greater rate of resprouting in Quercus after fire in the spring, but not after an autumn fire. Starch concentrations in roots fluctuated seasonally in all species, reaching minimum levels in May. Seedlings of both Quercus species maintained higher root starch levels and greater seasonal stability in starch levels than A. rubrum seedlings: results that may have contributed to the superior resprouting capacity of Quercus seedlings after spring fire. However, starch reserves could not account for differences in autumn fire survival, as starch concentrations in this season were high and roughly equivalent in all species, and there was little subsequent resprouting observed in surviving seedlings of any species. The lower rate of resprouting in A. rubrum seedlings may be attributable to some combination of morphological constraints and lack of starch reserves. Carbon allocation patterns of Quercus seedlings apparently favored maintenance of high root starch levels while carbon allocation of A. rubrum seedlings apparently favored rapid growth.

  Abstract                 = {Overstory tree thinning and prescribed fire are used to restore ecosystem structure and function in ponderosa pine (Pinus Ponderosa Laws.) forests of the southwest but little research has examined constraints on population-level responses of understory plants. In order to study growth and reproduction of a common shrub species after forest restoration treatments, we monitored Fendler ceanothus (Ceanothus fendleri Gray) plants from 1999 to 2002 in thinned and unthinned overstory units. To study effects of tree thinning, we analyzed relationships of overstory stand density (Reineke's SDI) and current-year branch length. number of branches, and biomass, and also evaluated the importance of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus) herbivory (Browsing) as a predictor in linear models. To study effects of prescribed fire, we examined mortality, seedling emergence, and growth response on experimentally burned and unburned plots. SDI and browsing were significantly and negatively correlated with F. ceanothus current-year branch length, biomass, and leaf area but relationships were generally weak. Across the 4 years, browsing appeared to be consistently more important than SDI in explaining variation in growth. Although SDI and browsing were significant predictors of growth in years with near normal precipitation, models failed in drought years. Burning resulted in 17-32% mortality whereas 0-5% of plants died on unburned plots. Mortality of burned plants was positively related to amount of forest floor consumed during prescribed fires. One growing season after fire, surviving burned plants responded by producing long resprouts. Current-year branches were consistently longer on burned than unburned plants only where plots were protected from large herbivores. Unburned plants had more current-year branches and greater biomass than burned plants. No seedlings emerged on unburned plots but were found on 44% of burned plots. A quadratic function represented the relationship between seedling emergence and forest floor consumption. Our results suggest that restoration treatments in ponderosa pine forests of nor-them Arizona can help increase abundance of F. ceanothus but population responses may be slow, particularly when constrained by ungulate herbivory, fire-related mortality of plants and dormant seeds. and drought.

  Abstract                 = {Phytoplankton communities reveal an astonishing biodiversity, whereas classical competition theory seems to suggest that only a few competing species can survive. Recently we suggested a new solution to this plankton paradox. In theory, at least, competition between multiple species can generate complex dynamics that can support a large number of species. How likely is it then, in reality, that competitive chaos indeed promotes biodiversity? To obtain some insight, we simulated multispecies competition according to five different physiological scenarios. For random species parameters, biodiversity was generally low. Assuming plausible physiological trade-offs, the simulations revealed switches back and forth between equilibrium and nonequilibrium dynamics, and a higher biodiversity. An extremely high biodiversiry, with sometimes more than 100 species on three resources, was observed in simulations that assumed a cyclic relation between competitive abilities and resource contents. We conclude that physiological and life-history patterns have a major impact on the likelihood of nonequilibrium dynamics and on the biodiversity of plankton communities.},

These findings were based on Liebig's Law of the Minimum, which assumes that each species is limited by only one resource at a time. In reality, however, resources can have interactive effects on growth. Here, we investigate whether competition for interactively essential resources may generate oscillations and chaos as well. Our results show that competition for interactively essential resources may, indeed, exhibit dynamics of similar complexity. This illustrates the wide potential for non-equilibrium dynamics generated by multispecies competition, and suggests that competitive chaos may occur on a wide variety of different resource types.},

  Abstract                 = {Biodiversity has both fascinated and puzzled biologists(1). In aquatic ecosystems, the biodiversity puzzle is particularly troublesome, and known as the 'paradox of the plankton'(2). Competition theory predicts that, at equilibrium, the number of coexisting species cannot exceed the number of limiting resources(3-6). For phytoplankton, only a few resources are potentially limiting: nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon, iron, light, inorganic carbon, and sometimes a few trace metals or vitamins. However, in natural waters dozens of phytoplankton species coexist(2). Here we offer a solution to the plankton paradox. First, we show that resource competition models(6-10) can generate oscillations and chaos when species compete for three or more resources. Second we show that these oscillations and chaotic fluctuations in species abundances allow the coexistence of many species on a handful of resources. This model of planktonic biodiversity may be broadly applicable to the biodiversity of many ecosystems.},

  Abstract                 = {Light is never distributed homogeneously since it forms a gradient over biomass. As a consequence, the common theories on nutrient competition are not applicable to competition for light. In this paper, we investigate a model for light-limited growth and competition among phytoplankton species in a mixed water column. The model is based on standard assumptions such as Lambert-Beer's law of light absorption, a Monod equation for carbon uptake, and constant specific carbon losses. By introducing the concept of quantum return, we show that the dynamics of growth and competition can be quantified not only in terms of depth but also directly in terms of light availability. We argue that the crucial measure for phytoplankton growth is not a ''critical depth'' but a ''critical light intensity,'' I-out*. For each species, I-out* corresponds to the equilibrium light intensity at the bottom of a water column when the species is grown in monoculture. I-out* plays a role similar to the ''critical nutrient concentration'' R* used in models of nutrient-limited growth. For a constant light supply, the species with the lowest I-out* will competitively exclude all other species. There are, however, some important differences between R* and I-out*. Whereas R* reflects both the local and the total balance between nutrient uptake and nutrient losses, I-out* only reflects the total carbon balance. Moreover, I-out* decreases with increasing light supply, whereas R* is independent of the nutrient supply. As a consequence, (1) the outcome of competition for light may depend on the light supply, (2) the compensation point is not a good predictor for the outcome of competition, (3) the resource ratio hypothesis does not apply when species compete for both nutrients and light. The outcome of competition for nutrients and light may depend on the nutrient and light supply, on the mixing depth, and on the background turbidity due to inanimate substances.},

Path analysis clearly showed that the number of vectors on individual tussocks was an important factor explaining levels of infection of A. heterospora. 3 The year-to-year correlations in incidence of A. heterospora disease for individual C. nigra plants were high, indicating that the same plants consistently experience high levels of disease. There were also high year-to-year correlations in the abundance of P. substriatus beetles on individual plants. 4 A second natural enemy of the sedge, the gall mite Phytoptus caricis, also showed high between-year correlations in levels of infestation. Since P. caricis competes for the same resource as A. heterospora, we predicted that high levels of P. caricis infestation should have a negative effect on disease levels. However, there was in general a positive effect of P. caricis infestation on A. heterospora disease levels. 5 This study shows that for understanding levels of disease of A. heterospora, both within-year effects as well as transient effects must be included. Phenotypic variation among plants in susceptibility to infection by A. heterospora could explain the observed patterns of disease but they could also be the result of host choice by the beetle.},

  Abstract                 = {We analyse the population dynamics of two strains of bacteria (Escherichia coli): one strain produces a toxin (called colicin) that increases the mortality of a colicin-sensitive strain in the neighbourhood, but does not harm the colicin-producing strain itself. On the other hand, in the absence of colicin in the environment: the colicin-sensitive strain enjoys a higher population growth rate. The model is closely related to the evolutionary dynamics of social interaction. It has been established previously that a perfectly mixing population shows bistability; that is, whichever strain dominates initially tends to defeat the other. On the other hand, empirical and computer simulation results in lattice structured populations show neither co-existence nor bistability of the two strains. In this paper, we analyse the lattice model based on pair approximation (forming a system of ordinary differential equations of global densities and local densities), and by the direct computer simulation of the spatial stochastic model. Both the pair approximation dynamics and the computer simulation show that, for most regions of parameter values, one strain defeats the other, irrespective of the initial abundance. However, the pair approximation analysis also suggests a relatively narrow parameter region of bistability, which should disappear when the model is considered on a lattice of infinitely large size. The biological implications of the results and the relationship of the present model with other models of the evolution of spite or altruistic behaviours are discussed. This suggests that the dynamics reflected by the spatially explicit lattice model may be sufficient, perhaps even necessary, to support the evolution of colicin.},

Positive allometry is favored by strongly sigmoidal growth, a strongly convex body-size/deterrence relationship, and a concave defense-size/deterrence relationship. Rapid early growth, a weakly convex body-size/deterrence relationship, and a convex defense-size/deterrence relationship favor negative allometry. The model is tested by comparing, among Pinus and Quercus species, measured intraspecific bark allometry with a predicted ranking of bark allometry along the negative-positive continuum. The ranking is based on the forms of body-size/deterrence and defense-size/deterrence relationships expected in each species' typical habitat given the fire regime and canopy type. This predicted ranking of bark allometry is significantly correlated with measured bark allometry. Negative bark allometry and thick sapling bark are associated with habitats characterized by frequent low-intensity fire and relatively open canopies. Fire-resilient Pinus spp. and species of infrequently burned, dosed-canopy forests tend to have positive bark allometry and thin sapling bark.},

  Abstract                 = {The mechanism of water-stress-induced embolism of xylem was investigated in Malosma laurina and Heteromeles arbutifolia, two chaparral shrub species of southern California, We tested the hypothesis that the primary cause of xylem dysfunction in these species during dehydration was the pulling of air through the pores in the cell walls of vessels (pores in pit membranes) as a result of high tensions on xylem water, First, we constructed vulnerability-to-embolism curves for (i) excised branches that were increasingly dehydrated in the laboratory and (ii) hydrated branches exposed to increasing levels of external air pressure, Branches of M. laurina that were dehydrated became 50% embolized at a xylem pressure potential of -1.6 MPa, which is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the +1.6 MPa of external air pressure that caused 50% embolism in hydrated stems, Dehydrated and pressurized branches of H. arbutifolia reached a 50% level of embolism at -6.0 and +6.4 MPa, respectively. Secondly, polystyrene spheres ranging in diameter from 20 to 149 nm were perfused through hydrated stem segments to estimate the pore size in the vessel cell walls (pit membranes) of the two species, A 50% or greater reduction in hydraulic conductivity occurred in M. laurina at perfusions of 30, 42, 64 and 82 nm spheres and in H. arbutifolia at perfusions of 20 and 30 nm spheres, Application of the capillary equation to these pore diameters predicted 50% embolism at xylem tensions of -2.2 MPa for M. laurina and -6.7 MPa for H. arbutifolia, which are within 0.7 MPa of the actual values, Our results suggest that the size of pores in pit membranes may be a factor in determining both xylem efficiency and vulnerability to embolism in some chaparral species, H, arbutifolia, with smaller pores and narrower vessels, withstands lower water potentials but has lower transport efficiency, M, laurina, with wider pores and wider vessels, has a greater transport efficiency but requires a deeper root system to help avoid catastrophically low water potentials.},

We compared real tree patterns from the southern Kalahari, derived from aerial photographs, with patterns produced from computer simulation experiments in an investigation of the following questions: does the present pattern of tree distributions allow us to characterize (1) the relative importance of the major driving forces (e.g., competition for moisture, grass fire, herbivory), (2) the spatial dimensions and structures of the underlying processes, and (3) the actual dynamic status of the ecological system (a phase of decline, increase or constancy with respect to tree abundance)? ...},

It affects plant growth and survival, hence determining the nature of the vegetation, and wildlife habitat. A plethora of different techniques have been devised to measure the canopy. Evaluation of the literature reveals confusion over what is actually being measured. This paper distinguishes two basic types of measurement: canopy cover is the area of the ground covered by a vertical projection of the canopy, while canopy closure is the proportion of the sky hemisphere obscured by vegetation when viewed from a single point. The principal techniques used to measure canopy cover, canopy closure, and a number of related measures are described and discussed. The advantages and limitations are outlined and some sampling guidelines are provided. The authors hope to clarify the nature of the measurements and to provide foresters with sufficient information to select techniques suitable for their needs.},

These pines occur in arid and semi-arid foothills and mountains of California that are subjected to frequent fires. Cone and seed traits of these three California pines are compared to those of four species of pines (sugar pine, P. lambertiana; Jeffrey pine, P. jeffreyi; ponderosa pine, P. ponderosa; and lodgepole pine, P. contorta) that occur in more mesic environments in the nearby Sierra Nevada mountains. The cones of the Sabinianae pines are large with thick, dense scales, and the scales of gray and Coulter pines are armed with sharp, recurved spines. The seeds of all three species are large, and those of gray and Torrey pines are nearly wingless. In contrast, the Sierra Nevada pines have small to medium-sized seeds with large wings that are initially dispersed by the wind. Heavy wing loading of the Sabinianae pine seeds causes them to fall rapidly, and they are not dispersed far by wind. However, animals remove the fallen seeds rapidly, and rodents and jays scatter hoarded many seeds in the soil. This caching activity results in seedling establishment. The unusual morphology of the cones and seeds of the Sabinianae pines is interpreted as a combination of traits that attract animal dispersers, thwart the foraging activities of seed predators, and promote the survival of seeds in an environment subject to frequent fires.},

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the economic feasibility of redberry juniper control and determine the optimum treatment cycle for maintenance burning. A response equation was used to estimate the relationship between herbage production and redberry juniper canopy. Data to estimate the relationship was obtained for a site in the Texas Rolling Plains. The analysis used chaining as the initial treatment and periodic prescribed burns as maintenance treatments. Additional livestock production resulting from brush treatments and the costs of treatments were estimated and used to calculate net present values of the investment in brush control over a 30-year time horizon. Net present values indicated that juniper control was economically feasible across a wide range of economic and environmental conditions. Prescribed burn intervals were found to be optimal at 7-year intervals under most conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Physical ecosystem engineers are organisms that directly or indirectly control the availability of resources to other organisms by causing physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials. Physical ecosystem engineering by organisms is the physical modification, maintenance, or creation of habitats. Ecological effects of engineers on many other species occur in virtually all ecosystems because the physical state changes directly create nonfood resources such as living space, directly control abiotic resources, and indirectly modulate abiotic forces that, in turn, affect resource use by other organisms. Trophic interactions and resource competition do not constitute engineering. Engineering can have significant or trivial effects on other species, may involve the physical structure of an organism (like a tree) or structures made by an organism (like a beaver dam), and can, but does not invariably, have feedback effects on the engineer. We argue that engineering has both negative and positive effects on species richness and abundances at small scales, but the net effects are probably positive at larger scales encompassing engineered and nonengineered environments in ecological and evolutionary space and time. Models of the population dynamics of engineers suggest that the engineer/habitat equilibrium is often, but not always, locally stable and may show long-term cycles, with potential ramifications for community and ecosystem stability. As yet, data adequate to parameterize such a model do not exist for any engineer species. Because engineers control flows of energy and materials but do not have to participate in these flows, energy, mass, and stoichiometry do not appear to be useful in predicting which engineers will have big effects. Empirical observations suggest some potential generalizations about which species will be important engineers in which ecosystems. We point out some of the obvious, and not so obvious, ways in which engineering and trophic relations interact, and we call for greater research on physical ecosystem engineers, their impacts, and their interface with trophic relations.},

  Abstract                 = {Ecosystem engineers are organisms that directly or indirectly modulate the availability of resources to other species, by causing physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials. In so doing they modify, maintain and create habitats. Autogenic engineers (e.g. corals, or trees) change the environment via their own physical structures (i.e. their living and dead tissues). Allogenic engineers (e.g. woodpeckers, beavers) change the environment by transforming living or non-living materials from one physical state to another, via mechanical or other means. The direct provision of resources to other species, in the form of living or dead tissues is not engineering. Organisms act as engineers when they modulate the supply of a resource or resources other than themselves. We recognise and define five types of engineering and provide examples. Humans are allogenic engineers par excellence, and also mimic the behaviour of autogenic engineers, for example by constructing glasshouses. We explore related concepts including the notions of extended phenotypes and keystone species. Some (but not all) products of ecosystem engineering are extended phenotypes. Many (perhaps most) impacts of keystone species include not only trophic effects, but also engineers and engineering. Engineers differ in their impacts. The biggest effects are attributable to species with large per capita impacts, living at high densities, over large areas for a long time, giving rise to structures that persist for millennia and that modulate many resource flows (e.g. mima mounds created by fossorial rodents). The ephemeral nests constructed by small, passerine birds lie at the opposite end of this continuum. We provide a tentative research agenda for an exploration of the phenomenon of organisms as ecosystem engineers, and suggest that all habitats on earth support, and are influenced by, ecosystem engineers.},

  Abstract                 = {Variation in phenotypic traits of angiosperm fleshy fruits has been explained as the result of adaptations to their mutualistic seed dispersers. By analyzing the information available on fleshy fruit characteristics of 910 angiosperm species, I assess the hypothesis of evolutionary association between fruit phenotypic traits and type of seed disperser (birds, mammals, and mixed dispersers) and address explicitly and quantitatively alternative null hypotheses about phylogenetic effects. Phylogenetic affinity among plant taxa is accounted for by comparative methods including nested ANOVA, phylogenetic autocorrelation, and independent contrasts. Averaging over the 16 fruit traits examined, phylogenetic effects down to genus level explain 61% of total variance. Phylogenetic autocorrelations are strong among close relatives, reaching significance for 11 of the 16 fruit traits examined. When assessed by independent contrast methods, correlated evolution between type of disperser and fruit traits is confined to fruit diameter. Differences among dispersal syndromes in other traits vanish after accounting for phylogenetic effects. These analyses reveal that seed dispersal syndromes are not entirely interpretable as current adaptations to seed dispersers. Their status as exaptations can be assessed by combining experimental studies of natural selection on fruit size and rigorous comparative and cladistic tests of adaptational hypotheses.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been suggested that abortion of ovules in perennials is caused partly by early acting genetic load (abortions due to 'bad offspring'). However, it is still unclear what proportion of abortions of naturally pollinated seeds are due to early genetic load. Here we suggest that variation between maternal genotypes (abortions due to 'bad maternal genotypes') may be an even more important factor causing genetic abortions than early load, based on results from Scots pine. The early load is severe in Scots pine: in experimental self-pollinations on average 76% of the seeds were aborted. Comparison of naturally pollinated and experimentally cross-pollinated seeds showed that the abortion rate of naturally pollinated seeds was only slightly, and not statistically significantly, higher than that of experimentally cross-pollinated seeds (30% vs. 26.5%, respectively). Thus, although early load can be high under self-pollination in Scots pine, it does not account for a high share of abortions of naturally pollinated seeds. Instead, maternal genotype determined the seed abortion rate: in a separate experiment using an experimental population (clonal stand), 29% of the total variance in seed abortion was due to variation between maternal genotypes. We studied further whether 'bad maternal genotypes' could be explained by trade-offs between seed abortion and other fitness functions. Only one statistically significant genetic correlation was found, a positive association between cone production and successful seed development. Thus 'bad maternal genotypes' aborted a higher proportion of their seed and produced less cones than the 'good maternal genotypes'.},

  Abstract                 = {Large wild fires occurring in forests, grasslands, and chaparral in the last few years have aroused much public concern. Many have described these events as "catastrophes" that must be Prevented through aggressive increases in forest thinning. Yet the real catastrophes are not the fires themselves but those land uses, in concert with fire-suppression policies that have resulted in dramatic alterations to ecosystem structure and composition. The first step in the restoration of biological diversity (forest health) of western landscapes must be to implement changes in those factors that have caused degradation or are preventing recovery. This includes changes in policies and practices that have resulted in the current state of wildland ecosystems. Restoration entails much more than simple structural modifications achieved though mechanical means. Restoration should be undertaken at landscape scales and must allow for the occurrence of dominant ecosystem processes, such as the natural fire regimes achieved through natural and/or prescribed fires at appropriate temporal and spatial scales.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the consequences of asymmetric dispersal rates (e. g., due to wind or current) for adaptive evolution in a system of two habitat patches. Asymmetric dispersal rates can lead to overcrowding of the 'downstream' habitat, resulting in a source-sink population structure in the absence of intrinsic quality differences between habitats or can even cause an intrinsically better habitat to function as a sink. Source-sink population structure due to asymmetric dispersal rates has similar consequences for adaptive evolution as a source-sink structure due to habitat quality differences: natural selection tends to be biased toward the source habitat. We demonstrate this for two models of adaptive evolution: invasion of a rare allele that improves fitness in one habitat but reduces it in the other and antagonistic selection on a quantitative trait determined by five additive loci. If a habitat can sustain a population without immigration, the conditions for adaptation to that habitat are most favorable if there is little or no immigration from the other habitat; the influence of emigration depends on the magnitude of the allelic effects involved and other parameters. If, however, the population is initially unable to persist in a given habitat without immigration, our model predicts that the population will be most likely to adapt to that habitat if the dispersal rates in both directions are high. Our results highlight the general message that the effect of gene flow upon local adaptation should depend profoundly on the demographic context of selection.},

Replicated restoration treatments were: (i) partial restoration - thinning to presettlement conditions; (ii) complete restoration - removing trees and forest floor material to presettlement conditions, native grass litter addition, and prescribed burning; and (iii) control. Within treatments, we sampled beneath different canopy types to assess the effects of pine invasion into grassy openings on soil respiration. Growing season soil respiration was greater in the complete restoration (346 +/- 24 g CO2-C m(-2)) and control (350 +/- 8 g CO2-C m(-2)) than the partial restoration (301 +/- 5 g CO2-C m(-2)) in 1995. In 1996, the complete (364 +/- 17 g CO2-C m(-2)) and partial (328 +/- 7 g CO2-C m(-2)) restoration treatments had greater growing season respiration rates than the control (302 +/- 13 g CO2-C m(-2)). Results suggest that restoration effects on soil respiration depend on interannual soil water patterns and may not significantly alter regional C cycles. Soil respiration from grassy openings was 15% greater than from soil beneath presettlement or postsettlement pines in 1995 and 1996. A lack of active management will decrease belowground catabolism if pines continue to expand at the expense of grassy openings.},

This paper first presents the challenges of mapping fuels: canopy concealment, fuelbed complexity, fuel type diversity, fuel variability, and fuel model generalization. Then, four approaches to mapping fuels are discussed with examples provided from the literature: (1) field reconnaissance; (2) direct mapping methods; (3) indirect mapping methods; and (4) gradient modeling. A fuel mapping method is proposed that uses current remote sensing and image processing technology. Future fuel mapping needs are also discussed which include better field data and fuel models, accurate GIS reference layers, improved satellite imagery, and comprehensive ecosystem models.},

  Abstract                 = {Fire management practices affect alien plant invasions in diverse ways. I considered the impact of six fire management practices on alien invasions: fire suppression, forest fuel reduction, prescription burning in crown-fire ecosystems, fuel breaks, targeting of noxious aliens, and postfire rehabilitation. Most western United States forests have had fire successfully excluded for unnaturally long periods of time, and this appears to have favored the exclusion of alien plant species. Forest fuel reduction programs have the potential for greatly enhancing forest vulnerability to alien invasions. In part this is due to the focus on reestablishing pre-Euro-American fire regimes on a landscape that differs from pre-Euro-American landscapes in the abundance of aggressive non-native species. We may be forced to choose between restoring "natural" fire regimes or altering fire regimes to favor communities of native species. Intensive grazing in many western forests may exacerbate the alien problem after fire and temporally decoupling grazing and fire restoration may reduce the alien threat. Many shrubland ecosystems such as the Intermountain West sagebrush steppe or California chaparral have a natural, high-intensity crown fire regime that is less amenable to forest restoration tactics. Historical use of prescribed fire for type conversion of shrublands to more useful grazing lands has played some role in the massive annual grass invasion that threatens these shrublands. Fuel breaks pose a special invasive plant risk because they promote alien invasion along corridors into wildland areas. Use of prescription burning to eliminate noxious aliens has had questionable success, particularly when applied to disturbance-dependent annuals, and success is most likely when coupled with ecosystem restoration that alters the competitive balance between aliens and natives. Artificial seeding of alien species as a form of postfire stabilization appears to cause more problems than it solves and may even enhance alien invasion.},

  Abstract                 = {The San Francisco East Bay landscape is a rich mosaic of grasslands, shrublands and woodlands that is experiencing losses of grassland due to colonization by shrubs and succession towards woodland associations. The instability of these grasslands is apparently due to their disturbance- dependent nature coupled with 20th century changes in fire and grazing activity. This study uses fire history records to determine the potential for fire in this region and for evidence of changes in the second half of the 20th century that would account for shrubland expansion. This region has a largely anthropogenic fire regime with no lightning- ignited fires in most years. Fire suppression policy has not excluded fire from this region; however, it has been effective at maintaining roughly similar burning levels in the face of increasing anthropogenic fires, and effective at decreasing the size of fires. Fire frequency parallels increasing population growth until the latter part of the 20th century, when it reached a plateau. Fire does not appear to have been a major factor in the shrub colonization of grasslands, and cessation of grazing is a more likely immediate cause. Because grasslands are not under strong edaphic control, rather their distribution appears to be disturbance-dependent, and natural lightning ignitions are rare in the region, I hypothesize that, before the entrance of people into the region, grasslands were of limited extent. Native Americans played a major role in creation of grasslands through repeated burning and these disturbance- dependent grasslands were maintained by early European settlers through overstocking of these range lands with cattle and sheep. Twentieth century reduction in grazing, coupled with a lack of natural fires and effective suppression of anthropogenic fires, have acted in concert to favor shrubland expansion.},

  Abstract                 = {Aim Native American burning impacts on California shrubland dominated landscapes are evaluated relative to the natural lightning fire potential for affecting landscape patterns. Location Focus was on the coastal ranges of central and southern California. Methods Potential patterns of Indian burning were evaluated based upon historical documents, ethnographic accounts, archaeological records and consideration of contemporary land management tactics. Patterns of vegetation distribution in this region were evaluated relative to environmental factors and the resilience of the dominant shrub vegetation to different fire frequencies. Results Lightning fire frequency in this region is one of the lowest in North America and the density of pre-Columbian populations was one of the highest. Shrublands dominate the landscape throughout most of the region. These woody communities have weak resilience to high fire frequency and are readily displaced by annual grasses and forbs under high fire frequency. Intact shrublands provided limited resources for native Americans and thus there was ample motivation for using fire to degrade this vegetation to an open mosaic of shrubland/grassland, not unlike the agropastoral modification of ecologically related shrublands by Holocene peoples in the Mediterranean Basin. Alien-dominated grasslands currently cover approximately one-quarter of the landscape and less than 1% of these grasslands have a significant native grass presence. Ecological studies in the Californian coastal ranges have failed to uncover any clear soil or climate factors explaining grassland and shrubland distribution patterns. Main conclusions Coastal ranges of California were regions of high Indian density and low frequency of lightning fires. The natural vegetation dominants on this landscape are shrubland vegetation that often form dense impenetrable stands with limited resources for Native Americans. Natural fire frequencies are not high enough to maintain these landscapes in habitable mixtures of shrublands and grasslands but such landscape mosaics are readily produced with additional human subsidy of ignitions. It is hypothesized that a substantial fraction of the landscape was type converted from shrubland to grassland and much of the landscape that underwent such type conversion has either been maintained by Euro-American land management practices or resisted recolonization of native shrublands. It appears that these patterns are disturbance dependent and result from anthropogenic alteration of landscapes initiated by Native Americans and sustained and expanded upon by Euro-American settlers.},

  Abstract                 = {Fire management of California shrublands has been heavily influenced by policies designed for coniferous forests, however, fire suppression has not effectively excluded fire from chaparral and coastal sage scrub landscapes and catastrophic wildfires are not the result of unnatural fuel accumulation. There is no evidence that prescribed burning in these shrublands provides any resource benefit and in some areas may negatively impact shrublands by increasing fire frequency. Therefore, fire hazard reduction is the primary justification for prescription burning, but it is doubtful that rotational burning to create landscape age mosaics is a cost effective method of controlling catastrophic wildfires, There are problems with prescription burning in this crown-fire ecosystem that are not shared by forests with a natural surface-fire regime, Prescription weather conditions preclude burning at rotation intervals sufficient to effect the control of fires ignited under severe weather conditions. Fire management should focus on strategic placement of prescription burns to both insure the most efficient fire hazard reduction and to minimize the amount of landscape exposed to unnaturally high fire frequency. A major contributor to increased fire suppression costs and increased loss of property and lives is the continued urban sprawl into wildlands naturally subjected to high intensity crown fires. Differences in shrubland fire history suggest there may be a need for different fire management tactics between central coastal and southern California. Much less is known about shrubland fire history in the Sierra Nevada foothills and interior North Coast Ranges, and thus it would be prudent to not transfer these ideas too broadly across the range of chaparral until we have a clearer understanding of the extent of regional variation in shrubland fire regimes.},

  Abstract                 = {Chaparral shrublands burn in large high-intensity crown fires. Managers interested in how these wildfires affect ecosystem processes generally rely on surrogate measures of fire intensity known as fire severity metrics. In shrublands burned in the autumn of 2003, a study of 250 sites investigated factors determining fire severity and ecosystem responses. Using structural equation modeling we show that stand age, prefire shrub density, and the shortest interval of the prior fire history had significant direct effects on fire severity, explaining >50% of the variation in severity. Fire severity per se is of interest to resource managers primarily because it is presumed to be an indicator of important ecosystem processes such as vegetative regeneration, community recovery, and erosion. Fire severity contributed relatively little to explaining patterns of regeneration after fire. Two generalizations can be drawn: fire severity effects are mostly short-lived, i.e., by the second year they are greatly diminished, and fire severity may have opposite effects on different functional types. Species richness exhibited a negative relationship to fire severity in the first year, but fire severity impacts were substantially less in the second postfire year and varied by functional type. Much of this relationship was due to alien plants that are sensitive to high fire severity; at all scales from 1 to 1000 m2, the percentage of alien species in the postfire flora declined with increased fire severity. Other aspects of disturbance history are also important determinants of alien cover and richness as both increased with the number of times the site had burned and decreased with time since last fire. A substantial number of studies have shown that remote-sensing indices are correlated with field measurements of fire severity. Across our sites, absolute differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) was strongly correlated with field measures of fire severity and with fire history at a site but relative dNBR was not. Despite being correlated with fire severity, absolute dNBR showed little or no relationship with important ecosystem responses to wildfire such as shrub resprouting or total vegetative regeneration. These findings point to a critical need for further research on interpreting remote sensing indices as applied to postfire management of these shrublands.

  Abstract                 = {Plant community diversity measured as species richness, is typically highest in the early post-fire years in California shrublands. However, this generalization is overly simplistic and the present study demonstrates that diversity is determined by a complex of temporal and spatial effects. Ninety sites distributed across southern California were studied for 5 years after a series of fires. Characteristics of the disturbance event, in this case fire severity, call alter post-fire diversity, both decreasing and increasing diversity, depending on life form. Spatial variability in resource availability is an important factor explaining patterns of diversity, and there is a complex interaction between landscape features and life form. Temporal variability in resource availability affects diversity, and the diversity peak in the immediate post-fire year (or two) appears to be driven by factors different from subsequent diversity peaks. Early post-fire diversity is influenced by life-history specialization, illustrated by species that spend the bulk of their life cycle as a dormant seed bank, which is then triggered to germinate by fire. Resource fluctuations, precipitation in particular, may be associated with subsequent post-fire diversity peaks. These later peaks in diversity comprise a flora that is compositionally different from the immediate post-fire flora, and their presence may be due to mass effects from population expansion of local populations in adjacent burned areas.},

  Abstract                 = {Evergreen chaparral and semideciduous sage scrub shrublands were studied for five years after fires in order to evaluate hypothesized determinants of postfire recovery and succession. Residual species present in the immediate postfire environment dominated early succession. By the fifth year postfire, roughly half of the species were colonizers not present in the first year, but they comprised only 7-14% cover. Successional changes were evaluated in the context of four,hypotheses: (1) event-dependent, (2) fire interval, (3) self-regulatory, and (4) environmental filter hypotheses. Characteristics specific to the fire event, for example, fire severity and annual fluctuations in precipitation, were important determinants of patterns of change in cover and density, supporting the "event-dependent" hypothesis. The "fire interval" hypothesis is also supported, primarily through the impact of short intervals on reproductive failure in obligate seeding shrubs and the impact of long intervals on fuel accumulation and resultant fire severity. Successional changes in woody cover were correlated with decreases in herb cover, indicating support for "self-regulatory" effects. Across this landscape there were strong "environmental filter" effects that resulted in complex patterns of postfire recovery and succession between coastal and interior associations of both vegetation types. Of relevance to fire managers is the finding that postfire recovery patterns are substantially slower in the interior sage scrub formations, and thus require different management strategies than coastal formations. Also, in sage scrub (but not chaparral), prefire stand age is positively correlated with fire severity, and negatively correlated with postfire cover. Differential responses to fire severity Suggest that landscapes with combinations of high and low severity may lead to enhanced biodiversity. Predicting postfire management needs is complicated by the fact that vegetation recovery is significantly controlled by patterns of precipitation.},

Factors leading up to this event were very different between forests, which comprised about 5% of the area burned, and shrublands. Three lessons are (1) although these fires were massive, they were not unprecedented, and future fires of this magnitude are to be expected; (2) the current fire management policy is not effective at preventing these massive fires; and (3) future developments need to plan for these natural fire events much the same way we currently incorporate engineering solutions to earthquakes and other natural catastrophes.},

  Abstract                 = {California chaparral and South African fynbos are fire-prone communities dominated by species exhibiting remarkable similarities in germination response. In both regions there are a substantial number of species with germination stimulated chemically by charred wood and smoke. This type of germination behaviour has arisen independently in distantly related families and is interpreted as convergent evolution. Heat-shock is also an important germination trigger that is widespread, although in both regions it is most common in the same families. Phylogeney may play an important role in the presence of this postfire germination cue in both regions, but a much more rigorous analysis is required to show that this trait represents a single unique event in each lineage. In both regions, germination response is not randomly distributed across growth forms and there are marked regional similarities in the type of germination behaviour associated with certain growth forms. Geophytes largely lack refractory seeds, which require fire-type cues for germination, but the presence of fire-stimulated flowering of bulbs and corms may time recruitment to subsequent postfire years. Annuals that cue germination to postfire conditions are predominantly triggered by chemicals from smoke and/or charred wood.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Smoke-stimulated germination in the post-fire flora of California chaparral does not appear to be triggered by nitrate. Application of freshly prepared unbuffered KNO-3 solutions (pH c. 6.2) failed to enhance germination of five populations of Emmenanthe penduliflora or one Phacelia grandiflora population, regardless of light or stratification conditions. 2. KNO-3 buffered at acidic pH (or unbuffered solutions equilibrated with atmospheric CO-2) did induce germination, but KNO-3 solutions at pH 7 failed to induce germination. Induction of germination is therefore not due to the nitrate ion per se, but rather to high (H+), although buffered controls gave weak germination at low pH, suggesting a role for H+ plus nitrate. However, other anions such as sulphate were equally as effective as nitrate at breaking dormancy. 3. The germination response to KNO-3 was affected by the type of filter paper used and this may be linked to differences in pH. 4. NO-2, at concentrations present in biomass smoke, was highly effective at inducing germination, and other oxidizing agents also induced germination. 5. Several growth regulators, including nitrite and gibberellin, were stimulatory only at acidic pH, but KCN was stimulatory across a broad pH range. 6. Germination decreased at smoke exposures longer than a few minutes. Also, smoked water samples effective at breaking dormancy were acidic and were less effective when buffered to pH gt 7. 7. Physical scarification of the seed coat induced germination but the effect was not due to penetration of a water barrier, or to enhanced oxygen uptake or to wound responses such as CO-2 or ethylene production. 8. Different effects of the gibberellin inhibitor CCC (chlorocholine chloride) suggested that the mechanisms of scarification-induced and smoke-induced germination may differ. 9. We conclude that either oxidizing gases in smoke and/or acids generated on burnt sites play a role in germination of post-fire annuals in chaparral.},

  Abstract                 = {California shrubland wildfires are increasingly destructive, and it is widely held that the problem has been intensified by fire suppression, leading to larger, more intense wildfires. However, analysis of the California Statewide Fire History Database shows that, since 1910, fire frequency and area burned have not declined, and fire size has not increased. Fire rotation intervals have declined, and fire season has not changed, implying that fire intensity has not increased. Fire frequency and population density were correlated, and it is suggested that fire suppression plays a critical role in offsetting potential impacts of increased ignitions. Large fires were not dependent on old age classes of fuels, and it is thus unlikely that age class manipulation of fuels can prevent large fires. Expansion of the urban-wildland interface is a key factor in wildland fire destruction.},

  Abstract                 = {Patterns of native and alien plant diversity in response to disturbance were examined along an elevational gradient in blue oak savanna, chaparral, and coniferous forests. Total species richness, alien species richness, and alien cover declined with elevation, at scales from 1 to 1000 m(2). We found no support for the hypothesis that community diversity inhibits alien invasion. At the 1-m(2) point scale, where we would expect competitive interactions between the largely herbaceous flora to be most intense, alien species richness as well as alien cover increased with increasing native species richness in all communities. This suggests that aliens are limited not by the number of native competitors, but by resources that affect establishment of both natives and aliens. Blue-oak savannas were heavily dominated by alien species and consistently had more alien than native species at the 1-m(2) scale. All of these aliens are annuals, and it is widely thought that they have displaced native bunchgrasses. If true, this means that aliens have greatly increased species richness. Alternatively, there is a rich regional flora of native annual forbs that could have dominated these grasslands prior to displacement by alien grasses. On our sites, livestock grazing increased the number of alien species and alien cover only slightly over that of sites free of livestock grazing for more than a century, indicating some level of permanency to this invasion. In chaparral,,both diversity and aliens increased markedly several years after fire. Invasive species are rare in undisturbed shrublands, and alien propagules fail to survive the natural crown fires in these ecosystems. Thus, aliens necessarily must colonize after fire and, as a consequence, time since fire is an important determinant of invasive presence. Blue oak savannas are an important propagule source for alien species because they maintain permanent populations of all alien species encountered in postfire chaparral, and because the vegetation mosaic in this region places them in proximity to chaparral. The speed at which alien propagules reach a burned site and the speed at which the shrublands return to their former closed-canopy condition determine alien invasion. Frequent burning of this vegetation alters the balance in favor of alien invasion. In the higher-elevation coniferous forests, species diversity was a function of fire severity and time since fire. High-intensity fires create gaps that decrease canopy coverage and increase light levels and nutrients for an ephemeral successional flora. Few species have persistent seed banks, so the time since fire is an important determinant of colonization success. There was a highly significant interaction between fire severity and time since fire for understory cover, species richness, and alien richness and cover. Understory was sparse in the first year after fire, particularly in low-severity burns, and increased substantially several years after fire, particularly on high-severity burns. Both fire severity and time since fire affected alien species richness and dominance. Coniferous forests had about one-third as many alien species as the foothill oak savannas, and fewer than half of the species were shared between these communities. Unburned coniferous forests were largely free of alien species, whereas some burned sites had a significant alien presence, which presents a challenge for fire restoration of these forests.}

  Abstract                 = {We describe a model of heath vegetation, in which species were classified into five functional groups based on characteristics of their propagule pools, post-fire growth, timing and mode of reproduction and competitive status. The model assumes no recruitment without fire and a simple competitive hierarchy based on vertical stature. A critical feature of the model is an initial post-fire window of 5-6 yr in which competition from overstorey species on understorey species is reduced. Understorey functional groups differ in their ability to exploit this window. In the field, we tested five predictions derived from the model: (a) overall species richness of understorey varies inversely with overstorey density as a result of a trend in richness of woody species, but not in herbaceous species; (b) where an overstorey was present in the previous fire interval, post-fire population density is reduced in a functional group of understorey serotinous resprouting shrubs, but not in a group of understorey obligate-seeding shrubs with soil seed banks; (c) in understorey serotinous resprouting shrubs, post-fire regrowth in resprouting individuals is adversely affected by the presence of an overstorey in the preceding fire interval; (d) in understorey serotinous resprouting shrubs, levels of pre-fire propagules are lower in the presence of an overstorey, reducing the density of post-fire recruits; and (e) in understorey serotinous resprouting shrubs, recruitment relative to the pre-fire population is unaffected by overstorey species within the window of reduced competition. Of these, three tests (a,b,d) supported the model, one (e) may support the model, but the results were inconclusive and one (c) did not support the model. Limitations and further applications of the model are discussed. Our results suggest that maintenance of high densities of overstorey populations is in conflict with conservation of some understorey species. Models of the type we propose will help identify and resolve such conflicts and promote the judicious use of fire to maintain full species diversity of plants.},

  Abstract                 = {Fragmented populations possess an intriguing duplicity: even if subpopulations are reliably extinction-prone, asynchrony in local extinctions and recolonizations makes global persistence possible(1-8). Migration is a double-edged sword in such cases: too little migration prevents recolonization of extinct patches, whereas too much synchronizes subpopulations, raising the likelihood of global extinction. Both edges of this proverbial sword have been explored by manipulating the rate of migration within experimental populations(1,3-6,8). However, few experiments have examined how the evolutionary ecology of fragmented populations depends on the pattern of migration(5). Here, we show that the migration pattern affects both coexistence and evolution within a community of bacterial hosts (Escherichia coli) and viral pathogens (T4 coliphage) distributed across a large network of subpopulations. In particular, different patterns of migration select for distinct pathogen strategies, which we term 'rapacious' and 'prudent'. These strategies define a 'tragedy of the commons'(9): rapacious phage displace prudent variants for shared host resources, but prudent phage are more productive when alone. We find that prudent phage dominate when migration is spatially restricted, while rapacious phage evolve under unrestricted migration. Thus, migration pattern alone can determine whether a de novo tragedy of the commons is resolved in favour of restraint.},

  Abstract                 = {Using a two-locus diallelic population genetic model, we studied the evolution and impact of flammable traits in resprouting plants. A flammability locus' determines the flammable character of a plant and the frequency of alleles at this locus affects the probability that any plant in the population will burn. A linked 'disturbance locus' determines how a plant fares in the presence or absence of fire. Thus, the frequencies of alleles at the flammability locus influence evolution at the disturbance locus. The evolution of flammability-enhancing alleles is influenced by asymmetries in the genotypic fitnesses as well as by the base flammability of the population and the genetic structure of the system (with tighter linkage increasing the possibility that the population becomes more flammable). We demonstrate that stable polymorphisms of plants differing in flammability alleles are possible. The magnitude of the organism's impact on the flammable character of the environment influences where such polymorphisms are expected. Furthermore, predictions concerning the evolution of alleles at the disturbance locus based solely on fitness asymmetries may fail due to the influence of plants on their environment. Unusual population dynamics, including stable and unstable cycles of genotypes, are also presented. The relation of this model to the Mutch hypothesis and the recently developed theories of 'niche construction' and 'ecosystem engineering' is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) in the south-eastern U.S. coastal plain differ from those in the rest of the species' range by having black heads with white nose and ears. Postcranially on the dorsum, they also show interindividual colour variation, ranging from all-light agouti to all-black non-agouti. I present results of experiments undertaken to test whether the evolution of these pigmentary features can be attributed to interactions with predators. Comparative static crypsis (when the squirrels are still) was tested by determining how well specimens of the squirrel morphs matched their backgrounds in terms of intensity (brightness) distributions and patch size. Comparative dynamic effects (when the squirrels are moving) were tested using captive red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis) and models of the fox squirrel morphs. Results indicated that morphs of coastal-plain fox squirrels with all-light backs are better static matches to unburned backgrounds than are the darker morphs with which they coexist. Against fire-blackened backgrounds, fox squirrel morphs with intermediate and all-black backs are better intensity matches than those with all-light backs, but the dark morphs are not better patch-length matches than light morphs. The superiority of dark morphs in intensity matching for a short time after a fire does not seem sufficient to account for their long-term maintenance. Hawks responded more slowly to moving fox squirrel models with intermediate amounts of black on the back than to all-light or all-dark morphs; this result suggests a possible factor that would favour retention of genes for dorsal blackness in the coastal-plain population. Patchy black and white heads appear to promote static crypsis of south-eastern fox squirrels, and hawks reacted more slowly to moving squirrel models with such colouration than to those with plain heads.},

  Abstract                 = {Hierarchical competition-colonization models have been used to explain limiting similarities among species, successional dynamics, and species loss under habitat destruction. This class of models assumes that there is an inverse relationship between competitive ability and colonization ability and that competitively superior species exclude competitively inferior species when both occupy the same site. This hierarchical model of performance trade-offs, however, exhibits some unusual behaviors in the high-diversity limit, including infinitesimally close species packing, pathologically slow dynamics, and fundamentally important regularities in trait-abundance relationships. In particular, under the condition of constant mortality across species, a 3/2-power-law relationship emerges between abundance and fecundity under infinite packing (abundance of a species with fecundity f is inversely proportional to f to the 3/2 power). In this article, we explore the high-diversity limit of the hierarchical competition-colonization model, with particular emphasis on patterns of species packing, species-abundance relationships, and system stability. Because of the potential for pathologically slow dynamics following perturbations and infinitesimally close species packing in the high-diversity limit for this class of models, the models may need to be modified to include more realistic mechanisms governing the extent and timing of interspecific competitive exclusion in order to effectively capture the structure and dynamics of real-world ecosystems.},

  Abstract                 = {In so far as it is associated with declining fertility and increasing mortality, senescence is directly detrimental to reproductive success. Natural selection should therefore act in the direction of postponing or eliminating senescence from the life history. The widespread occurrence of senescence is explained by observing that (i) the force of natural selection is generally weaker at late ages than at early ages, and (ii) the acquisition of greater longevity usually involves some cost. Two convergent theories are the 'antagonistic pleiotropy' theory, based in population genetics, and the 'disposable soma' theory, based in physiological ecology. The antagonistic pleiotropy theory proposes that certain alleles that are favoured because of beneficial early effects also have deleterious later effects. The disposable soma theory suggests that because of the competing demands of reproduction less effort is invested in the maintenance of somatic tissues than is necessary for indefinite survival.},

  Abstract                 = {Trade-offs in species performances of different ecological functions is one of the most common explanations for coexistence in communities. Despite the potential for species coexistence occurring at local or regional spatial scales, trade-offs are typically approached at a single scale. In recent years, ecologists have increasingly provided evidence for the importance of community processes at both local and regional spatial scales. This review summarizes the theoretical predictions for the traits associated with trade-offs under different conditions and at different spatial scales. We provide a spatial framework for understanding trade-offs, coexistence and the supportive empirical evidence. Predictions are presented that link the patterns of diversity observed to the patterns of trade-offs that lead to coexistence at different spatial scales. Recent evidence for the evolution of trade-offs under different conditions is provided which explores both laboratory microcosm studies and phylogenetic tests. Examining trade-offs within a spatial framework can provide a strong approach to understanding community structure and dynamics, while explaining patterns of species diversity.},

We also studied whether variation in PT is associated with inducible small heat shock protein expression (sHsp). Traits were measured in a common environment (CE) and in the field to partition effects of phenotypic plasticity and genetic divergence. We found little evidence for convergent adaptation of PT (CE measurements). Field measurements revealed significant plasticity for PT, which was also associated with increased sHsp expression. Compared to coastal congeners desert species had lower SLA in the CE. These differences were magnified in the field. There was a negative correlation between SLA and PT. Desert species also tended to have smaller leaves both in the CE and in the field. SLA and leaf size reductions represent repeated evolutionary divergences and are perhaps convergent adaptations for species radiating into the desert, while PT is highly plastic and shows little evidence for convergent adaptation in the congeneric species pairs we studied.},

Both species exhibit peak sHsp accumulation at 42degreesC. Encelia californica accumulated greater levels of sHsp at temperatures below 42degreesC, while E. farinosa had greater levels above 42degreesC. Encelia farinosa accumulates sHsp at temperatures up to 45degreesC, while E. californica does not synthesize sHsp above 44degreesC. Both species accumulated significant levels of sHsp while maintaining photosynthetic electron transport (F-v/F-m), but above the temperatures that elicited peak sHsp expression, levels of sHsp and F-v/F-m declined in parallel to zero. Encelia californica accumulated greater levels of sHsp more rapidly than E. farinosa following a 15 min, 42degreesC heat treatment; however, E. farinosa maintained greater F-v/F-m at all time points. Our results indicate that there are significant differences between Encelia species for sHsp accumulation but that these results depend on the duration, magnitude, and recovery time following temperature stress.},

  Abstract                 = {The genetic composition of P. contorta var. latifolia as determined by isozyme analysis was assessed and examined at 2 hierarchical levels; within closely spaced populations and within adjacent subpopulations. Four populations of lodgepole pine consisting of 125 trees each were sampled along an elevational gradient spanning a distance of .apprx. 2 km in the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado USA. Each population was further divided into 5 subpopulations. Four isozymes were electrophoretically resolved from needle tissue removed from each tree. Statistic characterizing the genetic structure were calculated including measures of genetic variability, tests of allelic heterogeneity and F statistics. Lodgepole pine has a relatively low level of genetic variation with 44% of its loci polymorphic, an average of 1.33 alleles/locus, heterozygous at 13.5% of their loci, and a polymorphic index of 0.144. Slightly < 1% of the observed genetic variability resided among the 4 populations with the remainder residing among the individuals within populations. A slight deficiency of heterozygotes was indicated by the F statistics analysis. Allelic distributions at the subpopulation level indicated that clustering was evident although not a predominant characteristic of the genetic pattern. Inbreeding and/or the pooling of individuals from different breeding groups are likely phenomena contributing to the genetic pattern in lodgepole pine over microgeographical distances.},

  Abstract                 = {Some species of coastal sage and chaparral shrubs of California are extremely tolerant of tissue dehydration, surviving water potentials as low as -9 MPa during dry summer months. Such low water potentials (high tensions on xylem water) are known to cause severe embolism formation in the xylem vessels of woody plants, blocking water transport and potentially causing shoot dieback. Thus drought hardy species of coastal sage and chaparral are either extremely resistant to water stress-induced embolism or they become severely embolized during summer drought. We compared the seasonal changes in xylem water potential and xylem embolism (percent loss in hydraulic conductivity of stem segments due to air emboli) between co-occurring Salvia mellifera (coastal sage) and Ceanothus megacarpus (chaparral) growing in the Santa Monica Mountains of southern California. We also determined the relative sensitivity of each species to water stress-induced embolism by artificially dehydrating branches and measuring percent loss in hydraulic conductivity of xylem tissues at a given water potential. We found that both species experienced the same minimum in seasonal water potentials (-8 MPa) but the xylem of S. mellifera lost 78% in hydraulic conductivity whereas the xylem of C. megacarpus lost only 17% in hydraulic conductivity. These values for a natural plant community were within 10% of those predicted by our artificial dehydration curves. Our estimate of susceptibility to water stress-induced embolism indicated that 50% loss in hydraulic conductivity would occur at -4.5 MPa for S. mellifera but at -11 MPa for C. megacarpus. Irrigation of S. mellifera for one summer reduced loss in conductivity from 78 to 38% and increased leaf areas 10-fold, indicating that xylem embolism and leaf drop were drought induced. Our results show that xylem tissues of S. mellifera are more sensitive to water stress and tissue dehydration than those of co-occurring C. megacarpus. The observed ability of S. mellifera to inhabit drier sites than C. megacarpus may result from drought deciduousness in summer and high growth rates in spring that facilitate rapid construction of new xylem and leaf tissues. It may be that facultative drought deciduousness in coastal sage is tightly coupled to drought-induced embolism of xylem tissues.},

Lower conductances and/or highly branched systems are encountered in seedlings, arid-land shrubs, herbs, and distal portions of shoot and root systems of trees. In order to quantify the hydraulic impact of cavitation in such systems, existing techniques have been modified. Branched shoot or root systems were prepared for measurement by removal of leaves, or root tips, respectively. The shoot or root system was enclosed in a vacuum chamber with the proximal end protruding and supplied with perfusing solution. Flow through the xylem was induced by chamber vacuum. Hydraulic conductance was determined from the slope of the flow rate versus pressure relationship. Xylem embolism was quantified from the increase in hydraulic conductance following high pressure (100 kPa) perfusion of solution through the plant. Examples are provided of the application of the method to cavitation studies in the cold desert shrub Artemisia tridentata.},

  Abstract                 = {We compared foliar physiology and several measures of tree resistance to insect attack among ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa var. scopulorum Engelm.) trees growing in thinned stands. Measurements were made in a second-growth ponderosa pine forest in northern Arizona where the basal area treatments (6.9, 18.4, 27.6, 78.2 m(2) ha(-1)) have been experimentally maintained by frequent thinnings for 32 years before our measurements began in 1994. Most of the physiological characteristics measured were affected by the basal area treatments. As stand basal area increased from 6.9 to 78.2 m(2) ha(-1), predawn water potential, midday water potential, net photosynthetic rate, resin production, phloem thickness, and foliar toughness decreased. Foliar nitrogen concentration was greatest in trees in the intermediate basal area treatments. Our results show that the physiological condition of second-growth ponderosa pine can be manipulated by silvicultural control of stand basal area, and support the hypothesis that high stand basal area increases tree stress and decreases tree resistance to insect attack.},

Similarly, a plant becomes infected at a rate which increases linearly with the number of infected plants within range M, up to some saturation level, F-2. An infected plant dies (and the site becomes vacant) at constant rate delta. We discuss coexistence results in one and two dimensions.

  Abstract                 = {The physiological responses of tree regeneration to fire were studied in openings in a mesic hardwood forest. Gas exchange, nitrogen concentration, and water potential were monitored on foliage of burned and nonburned regeneration of northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.), white ash (Fraxinus americana L.), and sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) following spring fires in 1989 and 1990. Fire led to a stimulation of light-saturated photosynthesis in foliage of resprouting plants, but the effect varied in magnitude among species. On average, photosynthesis of post-fire maple was 42% higher than that on nonburned plots, with corresponding increases occurring in stomatal conductance and leaf N concentration, Ln general, fire had a marginal effect on leaf properties of oak and ash. In 1990, the ratio of root area to leaf area and the water potential of sunlit foliage were significantly higher on burned than nonburned plots for maple, but not for oak or ash, paralleling trends in photosynthesis. There was little evidence of a treatment difference in soil moisture or nitrogen availability, and it appeared that fire-induced stimulations in photosynthesis were mediated primarily by changes in intrinsic (e.g., root area/leaf area ratio) as opposed to extrinsic (e.g., soil moisture) factors governing resource availability to the canopy of post-fire sprouts.},

  Abstract                 = {Organisms regularly modify local resource distributions, influencing both their ecosystems and the evolution of traits whose fitness depends on such alterable sources of natural selection in environments; We call these processes niche construction. We explore the evolutionary consequences of niche construction using a true-locus population genetic model, which extends earlier analyses by allowing resource distributions to be influenced both by niche construction and by independent processes of renewal and depletion. The analysis confirms that niche construction can be a potent evolutionary agent by generating selection that leads to the fixation of otherwise deleterious alleles, supporting stable polymorphisms where none are expected, eliminating what would otherwise be stable polymorphisms, and generating unusual evolutionary dynamics. Even small amounts of niche construction, or niche construction that only weakly affects resource dynamics, can significantly alter both ecological and evolutionary patterns.},

  Abstract                 = { Summary Pinus sabiniana Dougl. (grey pine) forms savanna forests in the foothills surrounding California's Great Central Valley. However, its fossil record, which dates from the late Miocene through the Pliocene and Pleistocene, is found exclusively in southern California, south of the species' present range. A total of twenty-nine isozyme loci, representing eighteen enzyme systems, was assayed to analyse the genetic structure in eight populations of grey pine and attempt to track its migration history from southern to northern California. Expected heterozygosity in the two southernmost samples was 0.128 and 0.150, and heterozygosity tended to decrease with increasing latitude, suggesting the loss of diversity as grey pine dispersed northward. However, genetic distances between populations were very small, even on opposite sides of the treeless Great Central Valley; and estimated time since divergence was 900 to 9000 years at a maximum. Wright's FST, the proportion of total genetic diversity among populations, was only 0.057, which is similar to values found in many conifers with continuous distributions. Nm, the number of migrants among populations per generation, was 4.1 to 6.7, depending on estimator, and indicates that gene flow is extensive, or was so in the recent past. In every population, observed heterozygosity was less than expected heterozygosity, and the fixation index, FIS, for the progeny was 0.128, which indicates a fairly high rate of inbreeding. The genetic similarity of disjunct populations, in combination with paleogeographic and paleoclimatic evidence, suggests that grey pine formed a continuous population throughout the Great Central Valley, perhaps between 12,000 and 8000 yrs BP. Its range became fragmented during the Xerothermic, when it ascended into the foothills. Gaps in its range correlate with late Pleistocene-early Holocene lakes in adjacent basins and with the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. },

  Abstract                 = {The economically important plum or cherry genus (Prunus) and the subfamily Amygdaloideae of the Rosaceae have a controversial taxonomic history due to the lack of a phylogenetic framework. Phylogenetic analysis using the ITS sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) was conducted to construct the evolutionary history and evaluate the historical classifications of Prunus and the Amygdaloideae. The analyses suggest two major groups within the Amygdaloideae: (1) Prunus s.l. (sensu lato) and Maddenia, and (2) Exochorda, Oemleria, and Prinsepia. The ITS. phylogeny supports the recent treatment of including Exochorda (formerly in the Spiraeoideae) in the Amygdaloideae. Maddenia is found to be nested within Prunus s.l, in the parsimony and distance analyses, but basal to Prunus s.l. in the maximum likelihood analysis. Within Prunus, two major groups are recognizable: (1) the Amygdalus-Prunus group, and (2) the Cerasus-Laurocerasus-Padus group. The clades in the ITS phylogeny are not congruent with most subgeneric groups in the widely used classification of Prunus by Rehder. A broadly defined Prunus is supported.},

We first investigate issues related to its definition as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper examines four key mechanisms of the seed size/number trade-off (SSNT) models to assess their relevance to a general understanding of plant community structure. Mechanism 1 is that large seeds have a greater probability of winning in competition against smaller seeds. I provide interspecific experimental evidence that there is a competitive hierarchy among seedlings based on seed size. Mechanism 2 is that a trade-off exists between the number and size of seeds produced for a given reproductive allocation. Negative correlations between seed size and number were found consistently across a range of species from a range of habitats, from published literature. Mechanism 3, that seedling-seedling competition is an important influence on species composition, was found to exist potentially in a range of environments, including annual-dominated, post-fire and gap-dynamic communities. However, there is little quantitative evidence available and this is likely to be a restrictive mechanism. Mechanism 4, that small seeds are superior colonists due to their greater number, was tested in a field experiment in a calcareous grassland community. No supporting evidence was found, suggesting that the SSNT is not an important determinant of structure in this community. Thus two of the four mechanisms can be considered to hold true generally, while the third mechanism may be valid in particular environments. The fourth mechanism did not apply in the community tested, but could be tested in a wider range of communities.},

However. inconsistent patterns have emerged from these studies. with varying mechanisms proposed to explain emergent relationships, We employ a theoretical framework. based on key theory lineages of vegetation dynamics and species coexistence, to examine relationships between species abundance and seed size. From these theory lineages, we identified four models and their predictions: the Seed size number trade-off model (SSNTM). the Succession model (SM), the Spatial competition model (SCM). and the Lottery model (LM). We then explored empirical evidence from ten diverse plant communities for seed size and abundance patterns. and related these patterns to model predictions. The SSNTM predicts a negative correlation between seed size and abundance, The SM predicts either a negative, positive or no correlation dependent on time since disturbance. while the SCM and LM make no predictions for a relationship between seed size and abundance. We found no evidence for consistent relationships between seed size and abundance across the ten communities. There were no consistent differences in seed size and abundance relationships between communities dominated by annuals compared to perennials. In three of the ten communities a significant positive seed size and abundance correlation emerged. which falsified the SSNTM as an important determinant of abundance structure in these communities. For sites in coastal woodland. the relationships between seed size and abundance were consistent with the predictions of the SM (although generally not significant), with fire being the disturbance. We suggest that the significant positive seed size and abundance correlations found may be driven by the association between large seeds and large growth forms., as large growth forms tend to be dominant. It seems likely that patterns of seed size and abundance in communities are determined by a complex interaction between environmental factors and correlations of plant attributes that determine a species' strategy.},

The shift is larger for species restricted to mountain habitats and for grassy species, which are characterized by faster population turnover. Our study shows that climate change affects the spatial core of the distributional range of plant species, in addition to their distributional margins, as previously reported.},

Specifically, it has been proposed that new comparative methods can distinguish the direct effects of natural selection on the distribution of a trait within a clade from the effects of drift, indirect selection, genotype-by-environment interaction, and uncontrolled environmental variation. Such methods can supposedly unravel the relative importance of these factors by the phylogenetic analysis of traits, performance attributes, and habitats. We argue that they cannot. We show that many different evolutionary mechanisms can, in principle, account for any one interspecific pattern, and we illustrate our case using examples from the comparative literature. We argue that these confounded mechanisms can only be unraveled if patterns of selection or genetic variation and covariation are directly measured in many species within a clade. Even though comparative methods are valuable for examining the evolutionary history of traits, they will often mislead in the study of adaptive processes.},

To test the validity of this notion, we evaluated theoretical and empirical work linking dispersal kernels to the relative abundance, distribution, dispersion, and coexistence of species. We found considerable theoretical evidence that seed dispersal affects species coexistence by slowing down exclusion through local dispersal and a competition-dispersal trade-off, yet empirical support was scant. Instead, most empirical investigations examined how dispersal affects species distribution and dispersion, subjects with little theory. This work also relied heavily on dispersal proxies and correlational analyses of community patterns, methods unable to exclude alternative hypotheses. Owing to the overall dichotomy between theory and empirical results, we argue that the importance of dispersal cannot be taken for granted. We conclude by advocating experiments that manipulate the seed dispersal pattern, and models that incorporate empirically documented dispersal kernels. },

  Abstract                 = {Plant invaders have been suggested to change soil microbial communities and biogeochemical cycling in ways that can feedback to benefit themselves. In this paper, we ask when do these feedbacks influence the spread of exotic plants. Because answering this question is empirically challenging, we show how ecological theory on 'pushed' and 'pulled' invasions can be used to examine the problem. We incorporate soil feedbacks into annual plant invasion models, derive the conditions under which such feedbacks affect spread, and support our approach with simulations. We show that in homogeneous landscapes, strong positive feedbacks can influence spreading velocity for annual invaders, but that empirically documented feedbacks are not strong enough to do so. Moreover, to influence spread, invaders must modify the soil environment over a spatial scale larger than is biologically realistic. Though unimportant for annual invader spread in our models, feedbacks do affect invader density and potential impact. We discuss how future research might consider the way landscape structure, dispersal patterns, and the time scales over which plant-soil feedbacks develop regulate the effects of such feedbacks on invader spread.},

  Abstract                 = {The Mediterranean climate, with its characteristic of dry summers and wet winters, influences the hydrologic and microbial processes that control carbon ( C) and nitrogen (N) biogeochemical processes in chaparral ecosystems. These biogeochemical processes in turn determine N cycling under chronic N deposition. In order to examine connections between climate and N dynamics, we quantified decadal-scale water, C and N states and fluxes at annual, monthly and daily time steps for a California chaparral ecosystem in the Sierra Nevada using the DAYCENT model. The daily output simulations of net mineralization, stream flow and stream nitrate (NO3-) export were developed for DAYCENT in order to simulate the N dynamics most appropriate for the abrupt rewetting events characteristic of Mediterranean chaparral ecosystems. Overall, the magnitude of annual modeled net N mineralization, soil and plant biomass C and N, nitrate export and gaseous N emission agreed with those of observations. Gaseous N emission was a major N loss pathway in chaparral ecosystems, in which nitric oxide ( NO) is the dominant species. The modeled C and N fluxes of net primary production (NPP), N uptake and N mineralization, NO3- export and gaseous N emission showed both high inter-annual and intraannual variability. Our simulations also showed dramatic fire effects on NPP, N uptake, N mineralization and gaseous N emission for three years of post. re. The decease in simulated soil organic C and N storages was not dramatic, but lasted a longer time. For the seasonal pattern, the predicted C and N. uxes were greatest during December to March, and lowest in the summer. The model predictions suggested that an increase in the N deposition rate would increase N losses through gaseous N emission and stream N export in the chaparral ecosystems of the Sierra Nevada due to changes in N saturation status. The model predictions could not capture stream NO3- export during most rewetting events suggesting that a dry-rewetting mechanism representing the increase in N mineralization following soil wetting needs to be incorporated into biogeochemical models of semi-arid ecosystems.},

  Abstract                 = {We tested the effect of root trenching on vegetation in closed-canopy and gap locations in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) forests. Based on theory, we expected belowground competition to be intense in a region with low summer rainfall, and trench responses were expected to be greater in the high light environment of the gaps. We installed I in deep trenches around study plots and lined the trenches to prevent reinvasion by tree roots. Soil moisture was measured monthly during the growing season for the first 3 years after trench installation. Vegetation in these trenched plots was compared with control plots 10 years after installation of the plots. Trenched plots with no vegetation manipulation averaged 92% total understory cover, while untrenched plots averaged 47% cover. Contrary to our expectation, both vegetation and soil moisture responses to trenching were greater in areas of high tree canopy cover than in gaps. Trenched plots under, closed canopies were moister than control plots throughout the growing season, while the trenching effect became apparent in the overall wetter gaps only at the end of the growing season. We conclude that understory plants at these sites were limited at least as much by belowground competition as by aboveground competition.},

  Abstract                 = {We compared the understory herb and shrub communities of pre-commercially thinned and unthinned young- and old-growth Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) stands. Sites were located in the Cascade Mountains of western Oregon. Young stands were approximately 40 years old at the time of sampling; thinning occurred 20 years earlier. Although tree spacing was wider in thinned than in unthinned stands, faster tree growth in thinned stands meant that thinning had no long-term effect on basal area of P. menziesii. The very large, widely spaced P. menziesii individuals in old-growth stands contributed similar basal area as the smaller trees in young stands; however, old stands had much higher basal area of shade-tolerant conifers. Although low shrubs responded positively to thinning, the difference in cover between thinned and unthinned stands was too small to be statistically significant. Ordination of sample plots in terms of their understory shrub and herb species composition identified a strong gradient in community composition from young to old-growth stands. Understory species associated with old growth included both gap specialists and those that may be dependent on the litter depth and mycorrhizal fungi of old-growth forest floors. Although both thinned and unthinned young stand composition were quite distinct from that of old-growth stands, thinned stands were more similar to old growth than were unthinned stands. Thinned stands had higher frequency of late-seral herbs than did unthinned stands. Forest generalist and release species showed mixed responses to thinning. We conclude that pre-commercial thinning may be a useful management toot to encourage old growth associated understory herbs without precipitating dominance of the understory by low shrubs and weedy species. Although thinning did accelerate tree growth, changes in the understory appear to have been precipitated by the transient increase in resource levels following thinning rather than by any long-term changes in stand structure.

  Abstract                 = {We investigated modes of regeneration of dominant species of the mexical vegetation after fire. The mexical shrubland shows a remarkable structural, morphological, and Aoristic similarity to Mediterranean-type vegetation and is considered a relict of the Madro-Tertiary Geoflora under a non-Mediterranean climate. This vegetation provides an ideal scenario to test the role of fire in Mediterranean ecosystems because historical fire occurrence is absent and the species assembly is constituted mostly by Madro-Tertiary elements and Neotropical species (some of them, endemic species from Mexico). The existence of congeneric species of the California chaparral allows us to determine the regeneration ability of these communities after fire in relation to resprouting and seeding strategies, which are widespread modes reported in the Mediterranean-type vegetation. By the experimental application of fire in the two biogeographical groups of species, we tested the hypothesis that low resprouting ability of California congeneric species (Madro-Tertiary species) after fire would indicate that fire has played an important selective force in the resprouting habit. A low resprouting ability in the Neotropical group of species would suggest that fire has molded the set of species dominating fire-prone environments. Our results indicated that resprouting is a widespread trait in the mexical species characterized by the presence of lignotubers and burls. Resprouting can be considered an ancient trait, probably linked to losses of aboveground biomass, that became a pre-adaptation in;Mediterranean fire-prone communities. The Neotropical group of species showed less ability to regenerate after fire. and small plants were more likely to die after disturbance in this group than in the Madro-Tertiary group. The resprouting feature and the seeder strategy of other species after a fire in the mexical shrubland are similar to Mediterranean-type ecosystems, emphasizing their common origin and the relevance of phylogenetic and biogeographical studies to explain current patterns of vegetation.},

  Abstract                 = {The mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, is a natural disturbance agent of considerable consequence in western pine forests. This economically and ecologically important insect has a strong requisite for maintaining a strict seasonality. Given this ecological requirement, it is somewhat surprising that no evidence for diapause or other physiological tinting mechanism has been found. Seasonality and phenological timing for this species are apparently under direct temperature control. We investigate the consequences of direct temperature control by first constructing a computationally efficient phenology model based on previously published temperature dependent developmental data. We explored the dynamic properties of this model when subjected to observed microhabitat temperatures representing a range of thermal habitats from one region of the mountain pine beetle distribution. We also investigated the consequences of global climate change on phenology and seasonality. Our results indicate that an adaptive seasonality is a natural consequence of the interaction between developmental parameters and seasonal temperatures. Although this adaptive phenology appears to be resilient to temperature fluctuations, changes in climate within the magnitude of predicted climate change under a CO2 doubling scenario are capable of shifting a thermally hostile environment to a thermally benign environment. Similarly, increasing temperature by the same amount resulted in phenological disruption of a previously favorable thermal habitat. We discuss the implications of these results for restricting the current distribution of mountain pine beetle, and the potential for shifting distribution caused by global climate change.},

Although many pest species have co-evolved relationships with forest hosts that may or may not be harmful over the long term, the effects on these relationships may have disastrous consequences. We consider both the data and models necessary to evaluate the impacts of climate change, as well as the assessments that have been made to date. The results indicate that all aspects of insect outbreak behavior will intensify as the climate warms. This reinforces the need for more detailed monitoring and evaluations as climatic events unfold. Luckily, we are well placed to make rapid progress, using software tools, databases, and the models that are already available.},

  Abstract                 = {Using data from three fires in northeastern Spain, we tested a condition necessary to support the idea that fire has been a factor in the evolution of the resprouting habit: populations of all resprouting species within a community should show high levels of genet survival after fires and show a low coefficient of variation. Species with high mean survival values were: Quercus ilex L., Phillyrea latifolia L., and Viburnum tinus L., with 88, 86 and 83% survival respectively; these groups had resprouts emerging from rootcrowns. Then followed Arbutus unedo L. (75%), Pistacia lentiscus L. (73%), Erica arborea L. (77%), Erica multiflora L. (57%) and Juniperus oxycedrus L. (55%). This last group had resprouts from lignotubers or burls. These two groups also differed in the variability around the mean: the first showed a lower coefficient of variation, 6-12, and the second ranged from 19 to 26. Slope exposure had no significant influence on the process of resprouting, but soil depth did, with precipitation as a covariate. In the shallow soil category, the difference in genet survival between southern and northern exposures was 14% (71% vs. 57%); while the difference in the deep soil category was low, 5% (87% vs. 82%). There was no significant interaction. The component of variance for soils was larger than that for species-specific effects; substantial overlap of the within-species variance indicated that species responded as if they were a single hypothetical population, in which most of the variation in chances of survival was due to the soil conditions. The possession of the resprouting habit did not ensure a high performance. Hence, we find weak support for fire as a factor in the evolution of the resprouting habit.},

  Abstract                 = {Explaining the maintenance of high local species diversity in communities governed by competition for space has been a longstanding problem in ecology We present a simple theoretical model to explore the influence of immigration from an external source on local coexistence, species abundance patterns, and ecosystem processes in plant communities. The model is built after classical metapopulation models but is applied to competition fog space between individuals and includes immigration by a propagule rain and an extinction threshold for rare species. Our model shows that immigration can have a huge effect on local species diversity in competitive communities where competition for space would lead to the exclusion of all but one species if the community were closed. Local species richness is expected to increase strongly when immigration intensity increases beyond the threshold required for the successful establishment of one or a few individuals. Community structure and species relative abundances are also expected to change markedly with immigration intensity. Increasing immigration causes total space occupation by the community to increase but primary productivity on average to either decrease or stay constant with increasing diversity, depending on the relation between immigration and local reproduction rates. These results stress the need for a regional perspective to understand the processes that determine species diversity, species abundance patterns, and ecosystem functioning in local communities.},

  Abstract                 = {Studies of forest change in western North America often focus on increased densities of small-diameter trees rather than on changes in the large tree component. Large trees generally have lower rates of mortality than small trees and are more resilient to climate change, but these assumptions have rarely been examined in long-term studies. We combined data from 655 historical (1932-1936) and 210 modern (1988-1999) vegetation plots to examine changes in density of large-diameter trees in Yosemite National Park (3027 km(2)). We tested the assumption of stability for large-diameter trees, as both individual species and communities of large-diameter trees. Between the 1930s and 1990s, large-diameter tree density in Yosemite declined 24\%. Although the decrease was apparent in all forest types, declines were greatest in subalpine and upper montane forests (57.0\% of park area), and least in lower montane forests (15.3\% of park area). Large-diameter tree densities of 11 species declined while only 3 species increased. Four general patterns emerged: (1) Pinus albicaulis, Quercus chrysolepis, and Quercus kelloggii had increases in density of large-diameter trees occur throughout their ranges; (2) Pinus jeffreyi, Pinus lambertiana, and Pinus ponderosa, had disproportionately larger decreases in large-diameter tree densities in lower-elevation portions of their ranges; (3) Abies concolor and Pinus contorta, had approximately uniform decreases in large-diameter trees throughout their elevational ranges; and (4) Abies magnifica, Calocedrus decurrens, Juniperus occidentalis, Pinus monticola, Pseudotsuga menziesii, and Tsuga mertensiana displayed little or no change in large- diameter tree densities. In Pinus ponderosa-Calocedrus decurrens forests, modern large-diameter tree densities were equivalent whether or not plots had burned since 1936. However, in unburned plots, the large-diameter trees were predominantly A. concolor, C decurrens, and Q chrysolepis, whereas P. ponderosa dominated the large-diameter component of burned plots. Densities of large-diameter P. ponderosa were 8.1 trees ha(-1) in plots that had experienced fire, but only 0.5 trees ha(-1) in plots that remained unburned. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  Abstract                 = {Although fire consumes much of the forest floor, few studies have examined the change in forest floor characteristics with increasing time since fire. Mixed forests of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Doug. Ex. laws) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga mensizii (Mirb.) Franco) in the inland northwest once burned with greater frequency than today. Fire exclusion over the last 100 years is believed to have caused a shift in forest structure, forest floor decomposition and nitrogen availability. However, no research has clearly demonstrated this in forests of the dry inland northwest. The objective of this study was to determine how fire exclusion has shaped forest structure and understory composition in ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir forests and how these changes have altered forest floor characteristics. Stand level and understory vegetation characteristics, organic horizon depth and biochemistry were analyzed along a 132-year chronosequence at 25 sites in second growth forests of western Montana. Principle components analysis confirmed that time since fire was significantly correlated to most biotic variables, including nutrient availability and indicates that the disturbance regime is tightly coupled to ecosystem function. Douglas-fir basal area, total shrubs and forest floor thickness were observed to increase with time since fire. Graminoids and forbs did not change significantly with time since fire. There was a significant increase in the content of total C, total N, NH4+ and potential mineralizable N (PMN) in the forest floor, while NO3- content decreased significantly with time since fire. Total phenols increased significantly and were positively correlated with forest floor thickness, total shrub cover, PN414 and NH4+, but not correlated with NO3- content, suggesting that phenolic compounds accumulate with time and may affect N transformations.

  Abstract                 = {The observation that a few species in ecological communities are exceptionally abundant, whereas most are rare, prompted the development of species abundance models(1-3). Nevertheless, despite the large literature on the commonness and rarity of species inspired by these pioneering studies, some widespread empirical patterns of species abundance resist easy explanation(4). Notable among these is the observation(5) that in large assemblages there are more rare species than the log normal model predicts(6,7). Here we use a long-term (21-year) data set, from an estuarine fish community, to show how an ecological community can be separated into two components. Core species, which are persistent, abundant and biologically associated with estuarine habitats, are log normally distributed. Occasional species occur infrequently in the record, are typically low in abundance and have different habitat requirements; they follow a log series distribution. These distributions are overlaid, producing the negative skew that characterizes real data sets.},

We also determined the spatial distribution of the two most common pests, mistletoe, Phoradendron pauciflorum Torrey, and the fir engraver, Scolytus ventralis LeConte, of white fir (Abies concolor (Gord. & Glend.) Lindl.) across a 25-ha grid to assess spread and what host and pest variables were related. In these open parklike stands the mean tree density was 160 trees/ha, of which 58% were trees >20 cm diameter at breast height (DBH). In these low-density, mixed-aged stands we found that mixed-conifer species were well represented with no one species being completely dominant. Percent cumulative mortality for the SSPM was 12.7%, ranging from 2 to 24%, with the greatest amount of mortality occurring in the larger size classes, trees greater than or equal to50 cm DBH. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that 78% of the mortality we observed was explained by pathogens and bark beetles (r(2) = 0.78, P = 0.0001, F = 84). Mean pest incidence for Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi Grev. & Balf. in A. Murray), white fir, and sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana Dougl.) was 21, 88, and 2%, respectively. We found a number of relationships among host and pest variables, as well as a pathogen- insect interaction, and across the SSPM we found that nonhost species may be interfering in certain host-pest interactions. Spatial patterns from the 25-ha grid survey revealed that both P. pauciflorum and S. ventralis incidence were widespread. Phoradendron pauciflorum showed no spatial structure across the 25 ha but S. ventralis showed some degree of spatial structuring across the survey area. We also found that mistletoe severity was negatively correlated with regeneration of white fir. In pristine forests, pathogens and insects influence mortality and regeneration success, affecting stand structure and composition.},

  Abstract                 = {Forest and mountain fynbos communities intermingle in the southwestern Cape, South Africa, but are distinct in terms of species composition and community processes. Fires occur frequently in fynbos communities, but seldom in the forest communities, which are usually restricted lo sheltered ravines or stream banks. Forest species establish in fynbos between fires, and may predominate eventually in exceptional circumstances. We proposed a conceptual model for the development of forest in fynbos and examined processes in the model related to nucleation and the establishment of forest species. Germination and establishment requirements of forest and fynbos species were examined to determine causes of community distinctness. Nuclei of forest species dominated by fruiting species had more seedlings of forest species and more species than nuclei dominated by non-fruiting species. Reciprocal sowings showed that forest and fynbos species have similar germination requirements, but the seedlings establish in their appropriate communities only. Germination studies demonstrated that soil moisture is not the only factor limiting establishment of forest species, and that enhanced soil nutrient levels, litter and a canopy of vegetation influence seedling survival even in wet conditions. Field studies, to characterize the habitats in fynbos vegetation in which forest seedlings are able to become established, showed forest seedlings 10 be associated with a tall herb layer and vegetation cover greater than 50%. Seedlings were invariably under or within 1 m of a perch, which could be a fruiting forest species or a fynbos shrub. Recruitment of fynbos species is coupled with disturbance whereas recruitment of forest species in fynbos is associated with nucleation and habitat amelioration, and occurs in the absence of fires. The lack of coupling of recruitment of forest species with disturbance results in the exclusion of forest from most areas of the fire-prone fynbos biome.}

  Abstract                 = {To elucidate broad-scale environmental controls of coniferous forest reproduction in the Sierra Nevada, California, we monitored reproduction for 5 years in 47 plots arrayed across a steep elevational (climatic) gradient. We found that both absolute seedling densities (stems < 1.37 m) and seedling densities relative to overstory parent tree basal area declined sharply with elevation. Rates of seedling turnover (the average of birth and death rates) also declined with elevation. In contrast, seed production was not predicted by elevation and was highly variable from year to year. During a mast year of seed production, the intensity of masting was uneven among plots. Seedling densities were elevated only during the single year immediately following the mast year, suggesting reproduction in our forests may be primarily limited by abiotic factors such as the availability of suitable sites and weather. Disturbance also clearly affected reproduction; plots that had recently burned had significantly higher seedling to parent tree ratios for Abies species, suggesting that even though established Abies concolor may be relatively susceptible to fire, the species can recover rapidly through prolific reproduction. Since reproductive failures may be our earliest signal of changing forest conditions, seedling dynamics could provide a sensitive, if variable, indicator of environmental changes.

  Abstract                 = {An introduced pathogen, white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola), has caused declines in five-needled pines throughout North America. Simultaneously, fire exclusion has resulted in dense stands in many forest types, which may create additional stress for these generally shade-intolerant pines. Fire exclusion also allows fuels to accumulate, and it is unclear how affected populations will respond to the reintroduction of fire. Although white pine blister rust and fire exclusion are widely recognized threats, long-term demographic data that document the effects of these stressors are rare. We present population trends from 2168 individuals over 5-15 years for an affected species, sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana), at several burned and unburned sites in the Sierra Nevada of California. Size-based matrix models indicate that most unburned populations have negative growth rates (lambda range: 0.82-1.04). The growth rate of most populations was, however, indistinguishable from replacement levels (lambda = 1.0), implying that, if populations are indeed declining, the progression of any such decline is slow, and longer observations are needed to clearly determine population trends. We found significant differences among population growth rates, primarily due to variation in recruitment rates. Deaths associated with blister rust and stress (i.e., resource competition) were common, suggesting significant roles for both blister rust and fire exclusion in determining population trajectories. Data from 15 prescribed fires showed that the immediate effect of burning was the death of many small trees, with the frequency of mortality returning to pre-fire levels within five years. In spite of a poor prognosis for sugar pine, our results suggest that we have time to apply and refine management strategies to protect this species.},

After 4 years, shoot production (height, length and number of derived shoots) and plant growth (height and cover) increased 1Â·4-2Â·5âfold in naturally established controls relative to exposed plants, depending on the measured variable. In the transplant experiment, the increases were 2Â·8-7Â·1âfold in controls relative to exposed plants 2 years after initiation of the experiment. The net loss of biomass in treatment vs. control plants in these experiments suggests a negative response to browsing which has been defined as underâcompensation. Alternative architectures in honey mesquites were evident at the end of the exclusion experiments: controls had long branches and an extended crown cover, while exposed plants had short branches and a compact crown cover. Results indicated that mesquites were able to grow under browser pressure by packing many stems in a compact matrix armed with spines and producing one or more shoots tall and wide enough to escape from jackrabbits.},

  Abstract                 = {This article considers the statistical issues relevant to the comparative method in evolutionary biology. A generalized Linear model (GLM) is presented for the analysis of comparative data, which can be used to address questions regarding the relationship between traits or between traits and environments, the rate of phenotypic evolution, the degree of phylogenetic effect, and the ancestral state of a character. Our approach thus emphasizes the similarity among evolutionary questions asked in comparative studies. We then discuss ways of specifying the sources of error involved in a comparative study (e.g., measurement error, error due to evolution along a phylogeny, error due to misspecification of a phylogeny) and show how the impact of these sources of error can be taken into account in a comparative analysis. In contrast to most existing phylogenetic comparative methods, our procedure offers substantial flexibility in the choice of microevolutionary assumptions underlying the statistical analysis, allowing researchers to choose assumptions that are most appropriate for their particular set of data and evolutionary question. In developing the approach, we also propose novel ways of incorporating within-species variation and/or measurement error into phylogenetic analyses, of estimating ancestral states, and of considering both continuous (quantitative) and categorical (qualitative or ''state'') characters in the same analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {Human-altered landscapes dominate the planet, yet little is known about their capacity to sustain plant functional diversity. Most conservation-orientated studies of such landscapes focus on species diversity, whereas less attention is given to functional traits and their conservation. We examine the functional diversity of herbaceous and shrubby plant communities in three forest habitats (understorey, tree-fall gaps and riverbanks) and three deforested habitats (pasture, roadside vegetation and pasture riverbanks), each replicated in three human-dominated landscapes in southern Costa Rica. We focus on six categorical traits related to forest regeneration, reproduction and dispersal: pollination mechanism, dispersal mechanism, growth form, fruit type, fruit size and seed size. We compared trait state richness and composition of each trait in forested and deforested habitats and how three pollination states (bat, bird and bee pollination) and three dispersal states (fur, bird and monkey dispersal) of conservation interest were distributed across these landscapes. Only one trait state was missing from forest, and none was missing from deforested habitats. Understorey and pasture were consistently trait state poor. Forested and deforested plots differed in trait state composition for all traits. Pasture riverbanks and road verges were compositionally similar to forest riverbanks and tree-fall gaps, for multiple traits. There were more compositional similarities between forested and deforested habitat types when abundance of individuals with a trait state was used as the basis for similarity measures than when the number of species with each trait state was used. Bat-, bird- and bee-pollinated plants and plants with bird- and monkey-dispersed fruits were most common in forest and pasture riverbanks whereas species with fur-dispersed seeds were more common in all deforested habitats. Functional diversity patterns were inconsistent across habitat types and locations but overall functional similarity was high between forested and deforested communities. Patterns of functional diversity were far more variable between habitats and landscapes than the consistent patterns found previously for species diversity.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite growing attention to how human activities alter plant communities, little is known about the ecosystem consequences of these changes. We explore the relationship between species and functional diversity of herbaceous and shrubby plant communities in forested and deforested habitats in three Neotropical landscapes. We focus on six traits: pollination mechanism, dispersal mechanism, growth form, fruit type, fruit size, and seed size. We ask: (1) What is the relationship between species richness and functional diversity (trait state richness)? (2) Do species/functional diversity relationships differ between forested and deforested habitats? and (3) Are observed species/functional diversity patterns more consistent with ecological filtering or differentiation-based assembly processes? We show that species richness is often a weak surrogate for functional diversity, depending on the trait. Species/functional diversity relationships differ significantly between forested and deforested habitats, but the nature of-differences is trait dependent. Dispersal mechanism and fruit type number increased more rapidly in deforested than forested habitats, but the opposite was true for most other traits. Using a null model, we found evidence of ecological filtering for most traits in both habitats. Results demonstrate that deforested habitats do not necessarily contain lower functional diversity than forest but that the ecological assembly processes influencing community function in deforested communities differ dramatically from forest.},

  Abstract                 = {Little is known about the extent to which plant population growth is limited by seed production. We studied two non-sprouting Protea species, both entirely dependent on seeds for recruitment after fire, to determine how flower harvesting would affect the size of the next generation after burning. Five harvesting treatments (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% inflorescence removal) were applied, each replicated four times in 10 times 10 m plots. Seedbanks were censused before a late-summer burn for each species and each replicate. The mean proportion of seeds surviving the burn until germination the following spring was 0.46 for Protea repens and 0.57 for Protea neriifolia. Of the seedlings that emerged, 90% and 55%, respectively, survived the first summer drought. Flower production in the 9 year old stand was strongly related to population density. Optimal plant densities for maximum flower production were estimated as 150 for P. repens and 70 for P. neriifolia. These target densities were greatly exceeded by seedling populations surviving the first summer drought in unharvested stands. If future density-independent mortality is negligible, the excess represents that part of the seedbank that could have been harvested before the burn without influencing future flower production. We developed a simple static model for setting flower harvesting levels in these seed-saturated populations. The predicted harvesting levels (50% of inflorescences in P. repens and 85% in P. neriifolia) were validated against the experimental harvests. We discuss the sensitivity of harvesting levels to variation in fecundity/density relationships, seed survival through a burn and seedling survival until flowering, and the implications for flower harvesting.},

A model of the population dynamics of Banksia ornata was developed, using stochastic dynamic programming (a state-dependent decision-making tool), to determine optimal fire management strategies that incorporate trade-offs between biodiversity conservation and fuel reduction. 2. The modelled population of B. ornata was described by its age and density, and was exposed to the risk of unplanned fires and stochastic variation in germination success. 3. For a given population in each year, three management strategies were considered: (i) lighting a prescribed fire; (ii) controlling the incidence of unplanned fire; (iii) doing nothing. 4. The optimal management strategy depended on the state of the B. ornata population, with the time since the last fire (age of the population) being the most important variable. Lighting a prescribed fire at an age of less than 30 years was only optimal when the density of seedlings after a fire was low (< 100 plants ha(-1)) or when there were benefits of maintaining a low fuel load by using more frequent fire. 5. Because the cost of management was assumed to be negligible (relative to the value of the persistence of the population), the do-nothing option was never the optimal strategy, although lighting prescribed fires had only marginal benefits when the mean interval between unplanned fires was less than 20-30 years.},

This study quantified sand pine extent and expansion and examined links between sand pine distribution and environmental factors in the Florida panhandle. Geographic information system analysis using aerial photographs (1949 and 1994) showed sand pine expansion and also increased canopy cover of sand pine over time. There was a high rate of conversion of longleaf pine to sand pine from 1949 to 1994 (44%), and conversion of sparse sand pine stands to dense sand pine stands (69%). Therefore, widespread changes in the Florida landscape were evident during a relatively short time period. Adjacency analyses showed a strong negative association between longleaf pine and dense sand pine and a positive association between riparian vegetation and dense sand pine. Distribution of sand pine across elevation demonstrated that sand pine expanded inland and upland into longleaf-pine forests. In 1949, sand pine was selectively located on sites below 30 m in elevations; by 1994, sparse and moderately dense sand-pine stands were found at all elevations. Thus, any area that may receive an input of sand pine seeds, most notably from riparian areas, is vulnerable to establishment.},

We review literature pertaining to effects of fire-insect interactions on ecological succession, use of prescribed fire for insect pest control, and effects of fire on insect diversity from northern and boreal forests in North America. Fire suppression policies implemented in the early 1900s have resulted in profound changes in forest species composition and structure. Associated with these changes was an increased vulnerability of forest stands to damage during outbreaks of defoliating insects. Information about the roles that both fire and insects play in many northern forests is needed to increase our understanding of the ecology of these systems and to develop sound management policies.},

  Abstract                 = {Events of regional-scale vegetation mortality appear to be increasing in a variety of biomes throughout the Earth and are frequently associated with increased temperatures, droughts, and often (but not always) with outbreaks of biotic agents such as insects and pathogens (for review, see Allen et al., 2010; Supplemental Information S1). The precise physiological mechanisms underlying plant mortality are poorly understood, which limits prediction of where, when, and how vegetation will change with future climatic variation (for review, see Supplemental Information S2). In particular, hypotheses regarding carbon starvation (failure to maintain metabolism or fend off biotic agents due to prolonged negative carbohydrate balance) and hydraulic failure (desiccation from failed water transport) have stimulated recent debate (Adams et al., 2009a, 2009b; Leuzinger et al., 2009; Sala, 2009; McDowell and Sevanto, 2010; Sala et al., 2010). In this Update, I offer a perspective on the mechanisms of drought-induced mortality by providing an integrated view of carbon metabolism in relation to stress and mortality, linking carbon metabolism with new evidence on the role of hydraulic failure in mortality, and identifying associated uncertainties. Drought is the predominant climate characteristic associated with mortality (Allen et al., 2010), but there are parallels with low temperature, light, and paleo-CO2 concentrations, from which I have cautiously drawn evidence regarding mechanisms of drought-induced mortality. Two novel results emerged from this review. First, well-known carbohydrate partitioning patterns are consistent with observations of carbohydrate concentrations in stressed but surviving plants as well as those that are dying, and these results support carbon starvation as a threat to survival during drought. Second, carbon metabolism and hydraulics are coupled via multiple interactions that are only recently becoming appreciated, including an enhanced risk of mortality in species that maintain narrow margins of hydraulic safety.},

  Abstract                 = {Severe droughts have been associated with regional-scale forest mortality worldwide. Climate change is expected to exacerbate regional mortality events; however, prediction remains difficult because the physiological mechanisms underlying drought survival and mortality are poorly understood. We developed a hydraulically based theory considering carbon balance and insect resistance that allowed development and examination of hypotheses regarding survival and mortality. Multiple mechanisms may cause mortality during drought. A common mechanism for plants with isohydric regulation of water status results from avoidance of drought-induced hydraulic failure via stomatal closure, resulting in carbon starvation and a cascade of downstream effects such as reduced resistance to biotic agents. Mortality by hydraulic failure per se may occur for isohydric seedlings or trees near their maximum height. Although anisohydric plants are relatively drought- tolerant, they are predisposed to hydraulic failure because they operate with narrower hydraulic safety margins during drought. Elevated temperatures should exacerbate carbon starvation and hydraulic failure. Biotic agents may amplify and be amplified by drought-induced plant stress. Wet multidecadal climate oscillations may increase plant susceptibility to drought-induced mortality by stimulating shifts in hydraulic architecture, effectively predisposing plants to water stress. Climate warming and increased frequency of extreme events will probably cause increased regional mortality episodes. Isohydric and anisohydric water potential regulation may partition species between survival and mortality, and, as such, incorporating this hydraulic framework may be effective for modeling plant survival and mortality under future climate conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Fuel reduction by mechanical thinning and removal was studied in mixed-conifer stands in northeastern Oregon between 1995 and 1997. A single-grip harvester was coupled with either a forwarder or a skyline yarding system, and operational economics, fuel reduction, stand damage, soil disturbance, effects on soil biota and down-woody material were measured in three replicates of paired stands. After logging with the harvester, the two log-extraction systems achieved nearly equivalent fuel reduction with 45.7 and 46.8% mass reduction by the forwarder and skyline system, respectively. Fine-woody fuel increased slightly in all units, but mass of heavy fuels decreased. Most mass reduction in the forest floor occurred in the duff layer with 56 and 49% reduction in forwarder and skyline units, respectively. Reduction in stem density and basal area were similar for the two extraction systems; in forwarder units stem density was reduced by 61.6% and basal area by 55.4%, while in skyline units stem density was reduced by 66.5% and basal area by 51.1%. Of seedlings and trees examined, 32% had noticeable damage after harvest. Damage included bole wounding (38.9% of damaged stems), bark scraping (35.0%), wrenched stems (28.9%), broken branches (26.5%), broken terminal leaders (15.4%), and crushed foliage (4.1%). More damage occurred to residual large trees than to seedlings. Both log-extraction systems met the silvicultural prescription of reducing fuel and protecting residual large-diameter western larch, Engelmann spruce, Douglas-fir, and lodgepole pine. While fuel, stem, and basal area reduction lowered fire risk from a model 10 to a model 8 in all stands, large-woody material for wildlife also changed. Mean log length was lower in harvested units relative to unharvested controls, but this did not decrease occupation of logs by ants or the activities of woodpeckers feeding on them. Of 37 logged hectares, 1.4% (0.5 ha) of the soil area was compacted, mostly in forwarder units, within landings, and within trails close to landings. The percent area with displaced soil varied from 5 to 43% among units and was located within trails or in intertrail areas between the trails. Light displacement of soil resulted in a short-term increase in the abundance of soil microarthropods. The effects of compaction on litter microarthropods was more persistent, with lower numbers in compacted litter a year after harvest. While revenue was similar for forwarder and skyline units ($68 vs. $70/metric ton, respectively), total operational costs were $81/metric ton in the skyline units, compared to $46/metric ton in the forwarder units. These results are discussed in the context of options available to managers for balancing fuel reduction needs with both environmental and economic constraints.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent theoretical approaches to community structure and dynamics reveal that many large-scale features of community structure (such as species-rank distributions and species-area relations) can be explained by a so-called neutral model. Using this approach, species are taken to be equivalent and trophic relations are not taken into account explicitly. Here we provide a general analytic solution to the local community model of Hubbell's neutral theory of biodiversity by recasting it as an urn model, i.e. a Markovian description of states and their transitions. Both stationary and time-dependent distributions are analysed. The stationary distribution-also called the zero-sum multinomial-is given in closed form. An approximate form for the time-dependence is obtained by using an expansion of the master equation. The temporal evolution of the approximate distribution is shown to be a good representation for the true temporal evolution for a large range of parameter values. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

  Abstract                 = {Interspecific comparisons of phenotypes are used extensively to test hypotheses about the evolutionary forces shaping phenotypic variation, but comparative data analysis is complicated by correlations due to the common ancestry of species. The method of evolutionary contrasts removes such correlations by estimating the amount of character change between pairs of closely related species that has occurred since their most recent common ancestors. The original method allows character change to be estimated only along pairs of branches on a phylogeny, but many hypotheses address change along single branches. In this article the method of evolutionary contrasts is extended to allow character change along a set of single branches on a phylogeny to be estimated, expected variances are presented, and it is shown that these extensions also result in a set of contrasts that are not correlated because of common ancestry. These extensions will allow hypotheses to be tested concerning character change associated with host or habitat shifts, changes in breeding system (e.g., monogamy vs. polygyny, monoecy vs. dioecy), changes in life history (e.g., semelparity vs. iteroparity), and changes in quantitative characters in many other situations in which one is interested in character change along single branches.},

  Abstract                 = {Using a simple two-patch model, we examine how patterns of spatial and temporal variation in carrying capacities affect natural selection on dispersal. The size of the population in each patch is regulated separately, according to a discrete-generation logistic equation, and individuals disperse from each patch at propensities determined by their genotype. We consider genotypes that express the same dispersal propensities in both patches and genotypes that express patch-specific disperal propensities. Contrary to previous analyses, our results show that some level of dispersal is favored by selection under almost all regimes of habitat variability, including a spatially varying and temporally constant environment. Furthermore, two very different polymorphisms are favored under different conditions. When carrying capacities vary spatially but not temporally, any number of genotypes with patch-specific dispersal propensities in ratios inversely proportional to the ratio of the carrying capacities can coexist. This result extends previous analyses to show that dispersal is favored in such an environment if individuals can alter dispersal propensities in response to environmental cues. In contrast, when carrying capacities vary both spatially and temporally but differ in mean or variance, a polymorphism of only two genotypes (a high-dispersal and a no-dispersal genotype) is favored when the only genotypes possible are ones expressing the same dispersal propensity in both patches. However, this dimorphism can be invaded and replaced by one genotype with a particular combination of patch-specific dispersal propensities in a ratio also inversely proportional to the ratio of the average population sizes. We discuss a number of testable predictions this model suggests about the amounts of phenotypic and genetic variation in dispersal characters that are expected both within and between populations, and the degree to which the expression of phenotypic characters affecting dispersal propensity should be sensitive to environmental conditions. The model also suggests novel mechanisms for coexistence between competing species in varying environment.},

(4) Pre-harvest age or size largely controlled survival and subsequent regrowth of coppiced Juniperus pinchotii plants. (5) Competition from neighbouring shrubs, though significant, explained little of the observed variation in survival or growth. Competition was most common during periods of active Juniperus growth. Competitive influence decreased with increasing distance, but not in a linear manner. (6) Competition from herbaceous plants was not detected.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine the degree to which landscape-scale spatial patterns of shrub-species abundance in California chaparral reflect topographically mediated environmental conditions, and evaluate whether these patterns correspond to known ecophysiological plant processes. Regression tree models are developed to predict spatial patterns in the abundance of 12 chaparral shrub and tree species in three watersheds of the Santa Ynez Mountains, California. The species response models are driven by five variables: average annual soil moisture, seasonal variability in soil moisture, average annual photosynthetically active radiation, maximum air temperature over the dry season (May-October), and substrate rockiness. The energy and moisture variables are derived by integrating high resolution (10 m) digital terrain data and daily climate observations with a process-based hydro-ecological model (RHESSys). Field-sampled data on species abundance are spatially integrated with the distributed environmental variables for developing and evaluating the species response models. The species considered are differentially distributed along topographically-mediated environmental gradients in ways that are consistent with known ecophysiological processes. Spatial patterns in shrub abundance are most strongly associated with annual soil moisture and solar radiation. Substrate rockiness is also closely associated with the establishment of certain species, such as Adenostoma fasciculatum and Arctostaphylos glauca. In general, species that depend on fire for seedling recruitment (e.g., Ceanothous megacarpus) occur at high abundance in xeric environments, whereas species that do not depend on fire (e.g., Heteromeles arbutifolia) occur at higher abundance in mesic environments. Model performance varies between species and is related to life history strategies for regeneration. The scale of our analysis may be less effective at capturing the processes that underlie the establishment of species that do not depend on fire for recruitment. Analysis of predication errors in relation to environmental conditions and the abundance of potentially competing species suggest factors not explicitly considered in the species,}

  Abstract                 = {Pre- and post-dispersal reproductive success was studied in 22 species from three related Southern Hemisphere families, Restionaceae, Ecdeiocoleaceae and Anarthriaceae. Pre-dispersal success was compared for resprouter and obligate seeder species using seed:ovule ratios and carpel:flower ratios. The data indicated a high level of variability between taxa but pre-dispersal reproductive success of obligate seeders was significantly higher (67% conversion of ovules to seeds) than that of resprouters (35%). Two seeders, an extremely rare species ('Chordifex' abortivus) and a strongly clonal species (Alexgeorgea subterranea), showed pre-dispersal reproductive success values lower than or equal to the mean value for resprouters. Post-dispersal reproductive success was predicted in terms of proportions of germinable seeds produced per ovule (as determined by in vitro germination of isolated embryos). Data again varied widely between taxa, averaging 23% conversion of ovules to seeds with no clear relationship to regeneration mode. The mean number of germinable seeds per culm ranged from 0.03 to 21 between species, with cases of particularly low ovule output and/or low germinability in critically low germinable seed numbers for a species. The regeneration potential of a subset of species was assessed as mean annual production of germinable seed per reproducing plant of a population. The data indicated low values (less than eight seeds per adult) for all but three highly fecund species, suggesting that germinable seed output in some species might be scarcely able to compensate for natural senescence or catastrophic loss of parent populations (e.g. after fire, disease, increased competition following eutrophication).},

  Abstract                 = {We evaluated the abundance of normative plants on fuel breaks and in adjacent untreated areas to determine if fuel treatments promote the invasion of normative plant species. Understanding the relationship between fuel treatments and normative plants is becoming increasingly important as federal and state agencies are currently implementing large fuel treatment programs throughout the United States to reduce the threat of wildland fire. Our study included 24 fuel breaks located across the State of California. We found that normative plant abundance was over 200% higher on fuel breaks than in adjacent wildland areas. Relative nonnative cover was greater on fuel breaks constructed by bulldozers (28%) than on fuel breaks constructed by other methods (7%). Canopy cover, litter cover, and duff depth also were significantly lower on fuel breaks constructed by bulldozers, and these fuel breaks had significantly more exposed bare ground than other types of fuel breaks. There was a significant decline in relative normative cover with increasing distance from the fuel break, particularly in areas that had experienced more numerous fires during the past 50 years, and in areas that had been grazed. These data suggest that fuel breaks could provide establishment sites for normative plants.. and that nonnatives may invade surrounding areas, especially after disturbances such as fire or grazing. Fuel break construction and maintenance methods that leave some overstory canopy and minimize exposure of bare ground may be less likely to promote normative plants.},

  Abstract                 = {Understory response to fuel reduction treatments was evaluated in fire-adapted ponderosa pine-Douglas-fir forests in northeastern Oregon. Treatments included: no management (control), prescribed fall burning (bum), low thinning (thin), and low thinning followed by prescribed fall burning (thin/burn), replicated four times in a completely randomized design. Treatment effects were observed in the first growing season after burning and three seasons after thinning. Species richness of the understory vegetation was significantly lower in the thin than in the control, but Shannon-Weaver's index of diversity was not affected by fuel reduction treatments. Graminoid cover was not influenced by treatment, forb cover was reduced in treatments that included thinning, and shrub and total cover were reduced in treatments that included burning. Individual species responded to treatment in a manner consistent with their life history characteristics. Prairie Junegrass cover increased in those treatments that included burning, while cover of other graminoid species was not significantly influenced. The thin treatment significantly lowered elk sedge and total cover, but did not strongly influence the cover of other species. Prairie Junegrass frequency increased significantly in the burned treatments, while western needlegrass frequency was significantly reduced. Frequency of other species tended to remain the same in all treatments. Resilience of community diversity to fire and the consistent effect of burning on individual species demonstrate their adaptation to frequent low-intensity fire, and the subsequent moderate impact of low thinning and fall prescribed burning on understory vegetation.},

Variation in annual rates of increase in fecundity and in numbers of flowering episodes before fire should be correlated with the degree of serotiny. These two attributes are a consequence of cone size, plant architecture and degree of serotiny.},

Beuk. and Mimetes fimbriifolius Salisb. ex J.Knight co-occur in the southern Cape Peninsula, where we studied their distribution patterns, demography and fire responses. Leucospermum conocarpodendron has relatively larger seedlings and is therefore the likely competitive dominant. Adults and seedlings of both species are widely spaced and interspecific competition is unlikely to cause competitive exclusion. Differences between the two species in recruitment levels and fire-mortality are small. Thus their size-class distributions are very similar. They are restricted to shallow-soil rocky habitats, not only because of reduced fire intensity in these sites, but because these are habitats avoided by the faster growing more competitive reseeding Proteaceae. Go-existence of these two species appears to mainly be due to fire keeping populations sparse, and ants keeping individuals fairly isolated.},

Fuel Moisture Influences The Fire Regime And Couples Fire To Climate. Fires Are Also Affected By Fuel Loads, Which Accumulate According To Forest Structure And Composition.

Impacts On Woody Biomass And Species Composition As A Result Of Climatic Change Were Site Specific And Depended On The Environmental Constraints Of A Site And The Environmental Tolerances Of The Tree Species Simulated. Climatic Change Altered The Fire Regime Both Directly And Indirectly. Fire Frequency Responded Directly To Climate'S Influence On Fuel Moisture, Whereas Fire Extent Was Affected By Changes That Occurred In Either Woody Biomass Or Species Composition. The Influence Of Species Composition On Fuel-Bed Bulk Density Was Particularly Important.

The chosen logit model indicated three covariates as significant factors in the probability of trees being colonized by the mountain pine beetle. The first covariate related to tree size and spatial relationships among trees colonized the same year; its effect was most obvious for trees in the smaller diameter classes. The other two covariates correlated with tree diameters and vigor, and they indicated a greater probability of attack for larger trees and trees with low vigor. The model showed that the probability of trees being colonized in this stand increased significantly as the outbreak gained momentum, but only as long as the food supply (trees with dbh greater-than-or-equal-to 23 cm) was abundant. It also showed that the pattern of selection of large and small trees did not change significantly as beetle pressure increased over time. Findings suggested that big trees were important to outbreaks beyond simply generating beetles, and that many trees were colonized only because they were close to other trees under attack.},

The largest single contributor to the present-day spread of seed mass was the divergence between angiosperms and gymnosperms, whereas the widest divergence was between Celastraceae and Parnassiaceae. Wide divergences in seed size were more often associated with divergences in growth form than with divergences in dispersal syndrome or latitude. Cross-species studies and evolutionary theory are consistent with this evidence that growth form and seed size evolve in a coordinated manner.},

Nevertheless, fire field studies on the soil temperature-time curves under summer conditions with controlled amount and structure of fuel are scarce. Experimental summer fires were conducted to analyse the influence of the fuel load and the fuel structure on the soil temperature-time profiles. The increase of fuel load from 2 to 4 kg m(-2) increased the net radiant heat per unit area (5691 to 11263 kJ m(-2)), the total duration of heat (190 to 396 min) and the duration of temperatures greater than 100 degreesC (19.8 to 35.9 min) whereas the peak temperature increased 100 degreesC (from 416 degreesC to 516 degreesC). Variations of fuel height from 1.5 to 0.75 m and bulk density from 2 to 4 kg m(-3) respectively, increased net radiant heat per unit area, H-p/a (6510 to 10 444 kJ m(-2)), t(total) (219 to 375 min), and t(>100 degreesC) (9.7 to 36.1 min) wheras T-max increased 40 degreesC (446 to 486 degreesC). At plot scale, fire intensity and severity will increase with the fuel load. At plant scale, more degradation will occur in the soil patches with higher bulk density, mainly because an increased duration of high temperatures in soil. Fuel amount and structure are then key factors in maquis fires since they will determine the post-fire patchiness of soil conditions and plant recovery.},

  Abstract                 = {Wildfires resulting from thunderstorms are common in some Mediterranean-climate regions, such as southern California, and have played an important role in the ecology and evolution of the flora. Mediterranean-climate regions are major centers for human population and thus anthropogenic impacts on fire regimes may have important consequences on these plant formations. However. changes in fire regimes may have different impacts on Mediterranean type-ecosystems depending on the capability of plants to respond to such perturbations. Therefore, we compare here fire regimes and vegetation responses of two Mediterranean-climate regions which differ in wildfire regimes and history of human occupation, the central zone of Chile (matorral) and the southern area of California in United States (chaparral). In Chile almost all fires result from anthropogenic activities, whereas lightning fires resulting from thunderstorms are frequent in California. In both regions fires are more frequent in summer, due to high accumulation of dry plant biomass for ignition. Humans have markedly increased fires frequency both in the matorral and chaparral, but extent of burned areas has remained unaltered, probably due to better fire suppression actions and a decline in the built-up of dry plant fuel associated to increased landscape fragmentation with less flammable agricultural and urban developments. As expected, post-fire plant regeneration responses differs between the matorral and chaparral due to differences in the importance of wild fires as a natural evolutionary force in the system. Plants from the chaparral show a broader range of post-fire regeneration responses than the matorral, from basal resprouting, to lignotuber resprouting, and to fire-stimulated germination and flowering with fire-specific clues such as heat shock, chemicals from smoke or charred wood. Plants from the matorral have some resprouting capabilities after fire, but these probably evolved from other environmental pressures, such as severe and long summer droughts. herbivory, and volcanism. Although both Mediterranean-type ecosystems have shown to be resilient to anthropogenic fires, increasing fire frequency may be an important factor that needs to be considered as it may result in strong negative effects on plant successional trends and on plant diversity.}

  Abstract                 = {Ecological restoration is the process of reestablishing the structure and function of native ecosystems and developing mutually beneficial human-wildland interactions that are compatible with the evolutionary history of those systems. Restoration is based on an ecosystem's reference conditions (or natural range of variability); the difference between reference conditions and contemporary conditions is used to assess the need for restorative treatments and to evaluate their success. Since ecosystems are highly complex and dynamic, it is not possible to describe comprehensively all possible attributes of reference conditions. Instead, ecosystem characteristics with essential roles in the evolutionary environment are chosen for detailed study. Key characteristics of structure, function, and disturbance-especially fire regimes in ponderosa pine ecosystems-are quantified as far as possible through dendroecological and paleoecological studies, historical evidence, and comparison to undisrupted sites. Ecological restoration treatments are designed to reverse recent, human-caused ecological degradation. Testing of restoration treatments at four sites in northern Arizona, USA, has shown promise, but the diverse context of management goals and constraints for Southwestern forest ecosystems means that appropriate applications of restoration techniques will probably differ in various settings.},

We used the same sampling methods as in the early 1900s and compared stand density, diameter distributions, species composition, and broad age classes from the two periods. Stand density (trees greater than or equal to9.14 cm dbh) significantly (P < 0.001) increased on plots from an average of 77.4 trees per plot (s = 49.9) at plot establishment in 1909-1913 to 519.1 trees per plot (s = 252.3) at remeasurement in 1997-1999. Basal area significantly (P < 0.001) increased from 8.0 m(2) per plot (s = 3.5) to 28.5 m(2) per plot (s = 10.1). Contemporary tree diameter distribution shifted toward smaller size classes as demonstrated by a significant (P = 0.001) decrease in quadratic mean diameter from 38.5 cm (s = 7.5) in 1909-1913 to 28.6 cm (s = 7.1) in 1997-1999. Broad age classes yielded an average of 61.5 (s = 49.5) residual live trees classified as "blackjack" ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa <150 years) and 13.3 (s = 11.9) "yellow pine" (P. ponderosa = 150 years) in 1909-1913. In 1997-1999, 416 live trees (s 229.6) were "blackjack" and 57.2 (s = 28.5) trees on average were "yellow pine." Twelve of the 15 plots were not invaded by other tree species (remained pure ponderosa pine type), while composition shifted slightly on three plots toward more shade-tolerant and fire-intolerant species. Ninety-one percent of the historically (1909-1913 or older) mapped tree structures (live trees, snags, logs, stumps, etc.) were relocated, which suggested that the forest reconstruction field techniques are reliable within 10%. Dramatic increases in tree densities may represent an increased potential for bark beetle epidemics and stand replacing wildfire over large areas in the Southwest.},

  Abstract                 = {The sprouting response types of 1,151 cork oak (Quercus suber) trees one and half years after a wildfire in southern Portugal were characterised. It was hypothesised that different response types should occur according to the following conceptual model: an increased level of damage (fire severity) on a sprouting tree that suffered a crown fire was expected to be reflected in a sequence of four alternative events, namely (a) resprouting exclusively from crown, (b) simultaneous resprouting from crown and base, (c) resprouting exclusively from base and (d) plant death. To assess whether the level of expected damage was influenced by the level of protection from disturbance, we explored the relationships between response types and tree size, bark thickness and cork stripping, using an information-theoretic approach. The more common response type was crown resprouting (68.8\% of the trees), followed by plant death (15.8\%), simultaneous resprouting from crown and base (10.1\%) and basal resprouting (5.3\%). In agreement with the conceptual model, trees which probably suffered a higher level of damage by fire (larger trees with thinner bark; exploited for cork) died or resprouted exclusively from base. On the other hand, trees that were well protected (smaller trees with thicker bark not exploited for cork) were able to rebuild their canopy through crown resprouting. Simultaneous resprouting from the crown and base was determined mainly by tree size, and it was more common in smaller trees.}

Results display a much richer diversity of opinion than is apparent in qualitative consensus summaries, such as those of the IPCC. Experts attach different relative importance to key factors and processes such as soil nutrients, fire, CO2 fertilization, competition, and plant-pest-predator interactions. Assumptions and uncertainties about future fire regimes are particularly crucial. Despite these differences, most of the experts believe that standing biomass in minimally disturbed Northern forests would increase and soil carbon would decrease. There is less agreement about impacts on carbon storage in tropical forests. Estimates of migration rates in northern forests displayed a range of more than four orders of magnitude. Estimates of extinction rates and dynamic response show significant variation between experts. A series of questions about research needs found consensus on the importance of expanding observational and experimental work on ecosystem processes and of expanding regional and larger-scale observational, monitoring and modeling studies. Results of the type reported here can be helpful in performing sensitivity analysis in integrated assessment models, as the basis for focused discussions of the state of current understanding and research needs, and, if repeated over time, as a quantitative measure of progress in this and other fields of global change research.},

We review and compare alternative data sources and approaches for mapping fire regimes at national, regional, and local spatial scales. Fire regimes, defined here as the nature of fires occurring over an extended period of time, are closely related to local site productivity and topography, but climate variability entrains fire regimes at regional to national scales. In response to fire exclusion policies, land use, and invasion of exotic plants over the last century, fire regimes have changed greatly, especially in dry forests, woodlands, and grasslands. Comparing among and within geographic regions, and across time, is a powerful way to understand the factors determining and constraining fire patterns. Assembling spatial databases of fire information using consistent protocols and standards will aid comparison between studies, and speed and strengthen analyses. Combining multiple types of data will increase the power and reliability of interpretations. Testing hypotheses about relationships between fire, climate, vegetation, land use, and topography will help to identify what determines fire regimes at multiple scales.},

  Abstract                 = {Extreme disturbance events may strongly influence the structure and functioning of many ecosystems, articularly those in which large, infrequent events are the defining forces within the region. This paper introduces the extremal fire regime (i.e., the time series of the largest fire per year) and the assumptions implicit in its analysis. I describe the statistics of extremes and demonstrate their application to the fire regime of Los Padres National Forest, California, to compare two regions (i.e., Main and Monterey divisions), to test for a shift in fire regime due to fire suppression, and to examine climatic events as a forcing mechanism for large fires. Despite their similarity and proximity, the Main Division exhibited a much higher frequency of large fires (and shorter return time) compared to the Monterey Division. Comparison of time periods 1911-1950 and 1951-1991 indicated that fire suppression had no effect on the distribution of very large fires in the Main Division, although the frequency of fires smaller than similar to 4000 ha declined. Comparing distributions of an index for severity of Santa Ana conditions (i.e., characterized by hot, dry winds) and extreme fire events in the Main Division indicated a convergence of distributions with increasing event size. The distribution of fire events larger than similar to 4000 ha appears to be coupled with that of severe Santa Ana conditions, suggesting a strong climatic forcing for extreme fires and a threshold for the transition from small-to large-fire dynamics. Results indicate the usefulness of extremal fire regime analysis for comparisons over space and time and for examining a potential forcing mechanism. This approach can be applied to any disturbance regime in which large events play an important role, providing ecologists and land managers with a useful tool for understanding and predicting dynamics of extreme disturbance events.},

Instead, the hazard of burning in most locations increases only moderately with time since the last fire, and a marked age effect of fuels is observed only in limited areas. Results indicate a serious need for a re-evaluation of current fire management and policy, which is based largely on eliminating older stands of shrubland vegetation. In many shrubland ecosystems exposed to extreme fire weather, large and intense wildfires may need to be factored in as inevitable events.},

Here, we examine historical fire catalogs and a detailed fire simulation model; both are in agreement with a highly optimized tolerance model. Highly optimized tolerance suggests robustness tradeoffs underlie resilience in different fire-prone ecosystems.

  Abstract                 = {Seeds of plant species from fire-prone vegetation often show dormancy, and germinate in response to fire-related cues. Seeds of some east Australian Grevillea species were known from earlier studies to germinate in response to fires, but gave mixed results when heat shock was tested as a germination stimulus. In the current study, seeds of seven east Australian Grevillea species were tested for their germination response to smoke, to short heat exposure, and to scarification. Seeds were smoked in a chamber by using a mixture of native woodland vegetation as fuel. The smoking and heating treatments were administered to seeds in bulk: this meant that subsequent germination data for these two treatments were not independent. Cumulative germination in the laboratory was scored for up to 60 days. All three germination treatments, when administered singly, increased germination: smoke increased germination in all seven species, heat in four species, and scarification in a different four species. Pairwise combinations of the three treatments also increased germination in some species e.g. smoke and heat treatments combined led to the highest germination observed in four species, and to increased germination compared with either treatment singly, in another species. Some treatment combinations appeared to interact: heat and scarification combined led to decreased germination in three species. The role of heat exposure and scarification in increasing germination was not due to the breaking of an impermeable seed coat: water uptake of both scarified and unscarified seeds was rapid and equal (after 24 h) in all seven species. The results indicate that seeds of the Grevillea species investigated are responsive to one or more fire-related germination cues.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper stresses that the mechanism of coexistence is the key to understanding the relationship between species richness and community productivity. Using model plant communities, we explored two general kinds of mechanisms based on resource heterogeneity and recruitment limitation, with and without any trade-off between reproductive and competitive abilities. We generated different levels of species richness by changing model parameters, in particular the number of species in the regional pool, the degree of recruitment limitation, and the level of heterogeneity. Different diversity-productivity patterns are obtained with different coexistence mechanisms, indicating there is no reason to expect any general relationship between species richness and productivity. We discuss these results in the context of the within-site and across-site aspects of the relationship between species richness and productivity. Furthermore, we extend these results to hypothesize the relationship between species richness and productivity for other coexistence mechanisms not explicitly considered here.},

Mean annual mortality between 1986 and 1990 was 0.8% for both watersheds. In the fall of 1990, the Tharp's Creek watershed was treated with a prescribed burn. Between 1991 and 1995, mean annual mortality was 1.4% in the unburned Log Creek watershed and 17.2% in the burned Tharp's Creek watershed. A drought from 1987 to 1992 likely contributed to the mortality increase in the Log Creek watershed. The high mortality in the Tharp's Creek watershed was primarily related to crown scorch from the 1990 fire and was modeled with logistic regression for white fir (Abies concolor [Gord. and Glend.]) and sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana [Dougl.]). From 1989 to 1994, basal area declined an average of 5% per year in the burned Tharp's Creek watershed, compared to average annual increases of less than 1% per year in the unburned Log Creek watershed and in the Tharp's watershed prior to burning. Postburn size structure was dramatically changed in the Tharp's Creek stands: 75% of trees less than or equal to 50 cm and 25% of trees >50 cm were killed by the fire.},

  Abstract                 = {The typical Mediterranean phrygana has a very rich biodiversity of plants and of solitary bees. Fire may kill the brood of soil-nesting and other solitary bees and may affect pollen and nectar sources. Such changes would be expected to influence seed production in populations of post-fire obligate seeder species and thus also their population dynamics. We compared nectar standing crop, flower visitation rate of bumble bees and solitary bees, and consequent seed production in a typical Mediterranean shrub (Salvia fruticosa Miller) growing in unburned east Mediterranean phrygana vegetation and in an adjacent burned area. The volume of nectar standing crop in the burned area was higher than in the unburned area, while the nectar concentration showed the opposite trend. The mean frequency of Bombus' visits was higher in the burned area, while solitary bees visited flowers only in the unburned habitats. The seed production of S. fruticosa was significantly lower in the burned area. This reduction might have a long-term effect on post-fire species composition and abundance due to the fact that this species is an obligate post-fire seeder. The present evidence indicates that the bee-dependent pollination environment was not re-balanced even six years after fire. This situation has important implications concerning plant species and their bee pollinator diversity.},

Although Aleppo pine Pinus halepensis Mill. is an obligatory post-fire seeder, it is adapted to regenerate in its pre-fire growing microsite, thus keeping suitable growing sites From generation to generation. We studied the effect of the dead burned adult pines on the density and size of their recruited saplings 2, 5, 11 and 20 yr after fire. A comparison of pine sapling density and size was made between the 'near' zone (under the former effect of the burned canopy) and the 'far' zone (beyond the former effect of the burned canopy). In the site 2 yr after fire, seedling density was 56% higher in the 'far' zone than in the 'near' zone, but seedling size was similar. However in the site 20 yr after fire, densities were similar in both zones, but the size was bigger by 89% in the 'near' zone. Thus, population recruitment after fire seems to peak near the burned pine trees rather than at a distance from them, in contrast to Janzen's original 'distance hypothesis' model suggested for undisturbed rainforest. Here we present a new hypothetical model for the spatial pattern of post-fire regeneration of obligate seeder tree species forming open forests. It is proposed that in such trees the microsites which were kept by the burned adult trees, which are killed by the fire, are also the Favorable regeneration microsite for the post-fire generation.},

  Abstract                 = {Three experiments were conducted to evaluate the use of solar radiation for reducing survival of mountain pine beetle populations in infested logs. Ponderosa pine logs were used in experiments 1 and 2 and lodgepole pine logs were used in experiment 3. Experiment 1 comprised three treatments: (1) one-layer solar treatment without plastic sheeting and logs rotated one-third of a turn once a week; (2) two-layer solar treatment with plastic sheeting; and (3) two-layer solar treatment without plastic sheeting. For experiment 2, two additional one-layer treatments were added: one-layer treatment with plastic sheeting and no rotation and a one-layer with no plastic sheeting and no rotation. Experiment 3 included all the above-mentioned one-layer treatments only. For all experiments, brood density per 0.05 m(2) (0.5 ft(2)) was estimated before and after treatment and analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance, Subcortical temperatures were monitored in one replicate of all treatments in all experiments. In experiment 2, phloem moisture was monitored before and after treatment in uninfested logs. All treatments in all experiments caused drastic reductions in brood survival. In experiment 1, the one-layer treatment with the logs rotated once a week significantly reduced brood survival compared to the two-layer without plastic sheeting treatment but was not different from the two-layer with plastic sheeting treatment. There were no differences in brood survival after treatment associated with any treatments in experiments 2 and 3. In all experiments brood survival was consistently reduced in the aspects of the logs exposed to the sun. Maximum temperatures were consistently higher in the treatments with plastic sheeting, the exposed surfaces of the logs to the sun, and the upper layer of logs in the two-layer treatments. No differences were detected in phloem moisture content in uninfested logs before and after treatment in experiment 2, suggesting that heat is directly responsible for the observed reductions in survival. We conclude that solar treatments are an effective alternative for reducing mountain pine beetle survival in infested ponderosa and lodgepole pine logs.},

The study concerns the organization of isoenzyme variation throughout the following subspecies of P. nigra (classification based on Vidakovic 1974): ssp. austriaca (7 populations), dalmatica (5 populations), pallasiana (4 populations), gocensis (4 populations), marocana, Fenzlii, corsicana, laricio, Villetta Barrea (all with 1 population) and 2 populations from Cyprus. The mean value for all samples of the average expected heterozygosity over 4 loci is 27.2%. The average number of alleles detected per locus is 3.02. Analysis of population subdivision using Nei's (1973) statistics indicates that heterogeneity within populations is higher than heterogeneity between populations or subspecies. The genetic distances (Nei 1972) associated with various stages of evolutionary divergence were calculated. Differences in allelic frequencies are statistically significant among the localities examined, but fail to show any decisive geographic patterning.},

  Abstract                 = {Background matching might lower the risk of seeds being eaten by seed predators that search visually. In aviary experiments, we analyzed the selection of different-colored seeds by ground-feeding finches (Fringilla coelebs and F. montifringilla) against four naturally occurring forest soil substrates. The substrates were fresh burn (black), 6-year-old burn (brown), mineral soil (pale yellow) and Pleurozium schreberi feather moss (green). We used color-sorted seeds of Pinus sylvestris, a species with a large natural variation in seed color, ranging from pale yellow to black. Although seeds were scattered on the substrates at a density of only 91 seeds m-2 , birds removed seeds effectively. Both bird species found more pale than dark seeds on the fresh bum substrate. F. montifringilla also recovered more pale than dark seeds on the old burn, and more dark than pale seeds on mineral soil. In moss, the birds found very few seeds compared to the other substrates, and there was no color discrimination. P. sylvestris is frequently regenerating after fire, suggesting that dark seeds would be favored under selection from visually searching predators. Fire-adapted conifers with serotinous cones, e.g., Pinus contorta ssp. latifolia, which spread their seeds primarily on freshly burnt surfaces, produce uniformly black or dark brown seeds. However, regeneration of the non-serotinous P. sylvestris is often extended for several years after a fire, during which substrate color and structure change. This may have helped to maintain variation in seed color. When regeneration of a plant species occurs on a substrate of uniform color, we believe that selection by visually searching seed predators will result in the evolution of cryptic seed color.},

  Abstract                 = {The Klamath-Siskiyou region of northwestern California and southwestern Oregon supports globally outstanding temperate biodiversity. Fire has been important in the evolutionary history that shaped this diversity, but recent human influences have altered the fire environment. We tested for modern human impacts on the fire regime by analyzing temporal patterns in fire extent and spatial patterns of fire severity in relation to vegetation structure, past fire occurrence, roads, and timber management in a 98,814-ha area burned in 1987. Fire severity was mapped by the US. Department of Agriculture Forest Service as low, moderate, and high based on levels of canopy scorch and consumption. We found (1) a trend of increasing fire size in recent decades; (2) that overall fire-severity proportions were 59% low, 29% moderate, and 12% high, which is comparable to both contemporary and historic fires in the region; (3) that multiaged, closed forests, the predominant vegetation, burned with much lower severity than did open forest and shrubby nonforest vegetation; (4) that considerably less high-severity fire occurred where fire bad previously be absent since 1920 in closed forests compared to where the forests had burned since 1920 (7% vs. 16%); (5) that nonforest vegetation burned with greater severity where there was a history of fire since 1920 and in roaded areas; and (6) that tree plantations experienced twice as much severe fire as multi-aged forests. We concluded that fuel buildup in the absence of fire did not cause increased fire severity as hypothesized. Instead, fuel that is receptive to combustion may decrease in the long absence of fire in the closed forests of our study area, which will favor the fire regime that has maintained these forests. However, plantations are now found in one-third of the roaded landscape. Together with warming climate, this may increase the size and severity of future fires, favoring further establishment of structurally and biologically simple plantations.},

  Abstract                 = {Morro manazanita (Arctostaphylos morroensis) is a distinctive shrub restricted to a small area along the coast of California, USA. This endangered species faces two opposing fire-related extinction risks: (1) adults are killed by fire, and (2) recruitment opportunities only occur with fire. These strongly limit the capacity of this, as well as other obligate-seeding species, to recover from a population decline, which may result if there is an inadequate amount of time between fires for replenishment of sufficient seed populations. Using a prescribed burn, we tested whether the size of the seed bank that had accumulated in a 40-yr-old stand would prove adequate for maintaining A. morroensis population sizes through fire. Prior to the burn, we found ~11,000 seeds/m2 in the soil, mostly in the top 5 cm. However, the number of viable seeds was substantially lower (334 seeds/m2), and less than one-third of these survived the experimental fire (99 seeds/m2). Germination occurred only in the first two wet seasons after the fire, and may have been adequate to replace the number of A. morroensis present before the burn. However, most seedlings did not survive their initial summer drought. After three years, the new population of A. morroensis was less than half the size of the parent population. Further mortality is expected because the remaining seedlings are highly clumped. We conclude that A. morroensis may require considerably longer than 40 years to establish an adequate seed bank to compensate for mortality and prevent population decrease or local extinction. This prolonged risk is perhaps explained by specialization of this species to a historic regime of relatively infrequent fire. There are many obligate-seeding species in fire-prone shrublands that may not be resilient to a regime of fire more frequent than that with which they evolved.},

  Abstract                 = {We documented patterns of surface heating associated with chaparral fire to characterize fundamental scale variation in the intensity of this stand-replacing disturbance. To test how this variation may influence community structure, we studied its effect on the soil seed bank and the distribution of seedlings and resprouts that emerged after fire. To evaluate the long-term significance of initial patterns, we monitored vegetation development for 4-5 yr, thereby encompassing the dynamic portion of the chaparral fire cycle. We studied two stands on level uniform terrain before, during, and after fall fires. Stands were dominated by chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum), a postfire seeder/sprouter. Nonsprouting Arctostaphylos and Ceanothus spp. were also present. Preburn vegetation, seed populations, soil heating, and postburn plant growth were analyzed along transects of contiguous 1-m(2) plots, so that we could block them together incrementally to identify scale dependence of patterns. In addition, we directly compared heating effects under the fuel array with those just outside by establishing plots in canopy gaps, under the adjacent canopy, and in gaps created and eliminated by reciprocally translocating fuel. Pre- and postburn seed populations were estimated in soil samples collected from all plots. The proportion of seed that survived above and below 2.5 cm in the soil was determined in a subset of plots. The amount and distribution of canopy fuel that collapsed during fire and smoldered on the ground caused pronounced spatial variation in total surface heating. The strength of relationships among patterns of soil heating, preburn canopy, surviving seeds, and seedlings and herbaceous resprouts was consistently most pronounced in blocks 3-5 m long. At this scale, postburn patterns were strongly negatively associated with the amount of preburn canopy and the pattern of soil heating this fuel created. Seedlings or herbaceous resprouts of numerous species were abundant where soil heating was relatively low, most notably in natural and created canopy gaps. Conversely, areas where dense canopy occurred before fire, especially gaps displaced by fuel addition, were barren except for occasional Arctostaphylos and Ceanothus seedlings. These obligate postfire seeders, along with the subshrub Helianthemum scoparium, had more deeply buried seeds, and some of them were able to survive where soil heating was prolonged. However, Helianthemum did not emerge from depth. Seedlings of Arctostaphylos and Ceanothus nearest Adenostoma burls survived significantly better when Adenostoma failed to resprout. This wan common in one burn where heating was relatively high and burl size was small. Seed mortality prevented Adenostoma seedling emergence from occurring where its seeds were most abundant prior to fire, which was in proximity to its burls. Adenostoma seedlings did emerge in areas of lower soil heating, but their survival was inversely related to the density of Helianthemum seedlings. No shrub seedlings emerged after the first year following fire because their seed banks were exhausted by fire-induced mortality and/or germination. After 4-5 yr, few young Adenostoma remained. The combination of seedling and resprout regeneration allowed this shrub to maintain dominance, but to a lesser extent in the older stand. Our results support a vegetation pattern-process model in which local species distributions after fire in Adenostoma chaparral are antecedently linked to the physical and chemical properties of the canopy. These control the nature of combustion, the soil heating that results, and the distribution of seeds and resprout tissues that survive. The vegetation develops entirely from these sources, so fire-induced patterns are manifest in the long-term structure of this vegetation.},

It assumes: (i) a population's capacity for niche construction is influenced by genes at the E locus; (ii) the amount of an environmental resource, R, depends on niche construction; (iii) changes in R affect selection at the A locus. This model produces some surprising results. For example, timelags occur between the spread of niche construction and the response to the selection it generates. Niche construction also enhances the role of phenotypes in evolution. Organisms not only carry and propagate genes, but they also modify the selection pressures that select those genes. This dual role changes the relationship between genetic evolution; individual development; learning; and cultural processes in human beings.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Up to 50% or more of the savanna landscapes of northern Australia are burnt each year, but the effects of these fires on savanna faunas are poorly known, especially for arthropods. 2. We investigated the responses of grass-layer beetles to three fire regimes (unburnt - fires excluded; early - annual fires lit early during the dry season; late - annual fires lit late during the dry season) as part of a landscape-scale fire experiment at Kapalga in Australia's Northern Territory, where replicated fire regimes were applied to 15-20-km(2) landscape units over a 5-year period. We also sought to identify beetle species that might act as indicators of particular fire regimes, and examined the extent to which analysis at the family level is sufficient to reveal patterns evident from species-level analysis. 3. Beetles were sampled using sweep nets during February (mid-wet season) and May (end of wet season) each year, from 1989 (18 months prior to the imposition of fire treatments) to 1995 (after 5 years of treatments). 4. A total of 3865 beetles from 233 species was recorded, with the dominant families Chrysomelidae (leaf beetles) and Curculionidae (weevils) contributing 91% of all beetles and 57% of total species. 5. Total beetle abundance, species richness, family richness and the abundances of one of the 10 most common species were significantly affected by fire treatment according to anova. In all cases, beetle abundance and richness were similar in the two burning treatments, but greater than in the unburnt treatment. These differences were only apparent during the second half of the experiment. The responses were mirrored by changes in composition at species, family and guild levels, according to multivariate analysis. 6. According to indicator analysis, five beetle species were significant indicators of late fires, and one of early fires. All these species were infrequently recorded and therefore of limited use for management. However, two common species were indicative of burnt habitats if early and late treatments are considered together. 7. Family richness was highly correlated (R(2) = 0.615) with species richness, and multivariate, analysis of family-level abundances revealed the compositional changes in relation to fire that were evident in species-level analysis. Family was therefore a reliable surrogate of species for detecting beetle responses. 8. Although we found significant effects of our experimental treatments, in the broader context of overall beetle dynamics the assemblages appeared to be remarkably resilient to fire. This reflects a long history of association with frequent fire, and is consistent with many other components of the northern Australian fauna, where fire appears to be of secondary importance to variation in rainfall and soil type. 9. The lack of effect of fire timing on grass-layer beetles calls into question a management paradigm that focuses largely on fire intensity, and suggests that fire management needs to be more mindful of fire frequency.},

  Abstract                 = {In periodically burned ecosystems, fire frequency may be an important selective pressure for the evolution of plant reproductive allocation patterns. We evaluated this hypothesis for Florida (USA) scrub plants by developing three models of reproductive effort with time since last fire given assumptions concerning seed dormancy and seedling establishment. We then examined reproductive effort of five woody, resprouting shrubs at sites representing nine times since last fire (ranging from 0-64 yr). All species showed significant patterns with time since fire in percentage of stems reproductive and fruit production. Stems of all species needed to attain a minimum size before flowering. Four species had the greatest level of reproductive effort (fruit biomass/above-ground biomass) within 5 yr post-fire and best fit the Early Peak Model of reproductive effort (i.e. between-fire seedling recruitment or seed dormancy). A fifth species best fit the Broad Peak Model (i.e. immediate post-fire seedling establishment), peaking in reproductive effort at 7 yr post-fire. Both of these models are based on somewhat variable fire-return intervals, suggesting that the frequency of scrub fires may have been too unpredictable to select for reproductive allocation patterns precisely reflecting particular fire-retum intervals. Early peaks in post-fire reproductive effort may be a bet-hedging strategy to allow for greater chances of seedling establishment and survival.},

  Abstract                 = {The objective was to determine the effectiveness of a regular prescribed burning program for reducing tree mortality in southern pine forests burned by wildfire. This study was conducted on public and industry lands in northeast Florida. On the Osceola National Forest, mean mortality was 35% in natural stands and 43% in plantations two growing seasons after a June 1998 wildfire. Burn history significantly affected mortality with those stands prescribe-burned 1.5 yr prior to the wildfire having the lowest mortality, while stands prescribe-burned 2 or more years prior had higher mortality. Although significant tree mortality did occur on the Osceola National Forest, with all trees killed in some stands, many trees in other burned stands did survive. The overall mortality was lower in both plantations and natural stands on the Osceola than at Tiger Bay where prescribed burning had been less frequent. The highest mortality rates occurred on the Lake Butler Forest where prescribed burning had not been used since plantation establishment. Thus, a regular prescribed burning program will reduce mortality following wildfires in both natural and planted stands of southern pines on flat woods sites, even when wildfires occur under severe drought conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {A Simple mathematical model of competition is developed that includes two alternative mechanisms promoting successional diversity. The first underpins the competition-colonization hypothesis in which early successional species are able to persist because they colonize disturbed habitats before the arrival of late successional dominant competitors. The second underpins the niche hypothesis, in which early successional species are able to persist, even with unlimited colonization by late successional dominants, because they specialize on the resource-rich conditions typical of recently disturbed sites. We modify the widely studied competition-colonization model so that it also includes the mechanism behind the niche hypothesis. Analysis of this model suggests simple experiments that determine whether the successional diversity of a field system is maintained primarily by the competition-colonization mechanism, primarily by the niche mechanism, by neither, or by both. We develop quantitative metrics of the relative importance of the two mechanisms. We also discuss the implications for the management of biodiversity in communities structured by the two mechanisms.},

  Abstract                 = {We study two kinds of mechanistic and spatial models of plant competition in heterogeneous environments. First, we study lottery models in which the outcome of competition among juveniles for vacant space is determined by one of several underlying mechanistic submodels. Environmental heterogeneity that affects the outcome of competition is present in all of these models and may be spatial, temporal, biotic in origin, abiotic in origin, or any mixture of these. The principal result is that the models predict coexistence if the plant species are sufficiently dissimilar-if they sufficiently partition the spatial, temporal, biotic, or abiotic environmental heterogeneity. Second, we study a complex forest-simulation model of competition among individuals for light and a nutrient. Whereas the nonspatial version of this model predicts that a single species will outcompete all others, the spatial version predicts that coexistence is possible. We show that the results for the analytically tractable models appear to explain the cause and pattern of coexistence in the simulation model.},

  Abstract                 = {Evolutionary processes shape the regular trends of evolution and are responsible for the diversity and distribution of contemporary species. They include correlated evolutionary change and trajectories of trail evolution, convergent and parallel evolution, differential rates of evolution, speciation and extinction, the order and direction of change in characters, and the nature of the evolutionary process itself - does change accumulate gradually, episodically, or in punctuational bursts. Phylogenies, in combination with information on species, contain the imprint of these historical evolutionary processes. By applying comparative methods based upon statistical models of evolution to well resolved phylogenies, it is possible to infer the historical evolutionary processes that must have existed in the past, given the patterns of diversity seen in the present. I describe a set of maximum likelihood statistical methods for inferring such processes. The methods estimate parameters of statistical models for inferring correlated evolutionary change in continuously varying characters, for detecting correlated evolution in discrete characters, for estimating rates of evolution, and for investigating the nature of the evolutionary process itself. They also anticipate the wealth of information becoming available to biological scientists from genetic studies that pin down relationships among organisms with unprecedented accuracy.

The method assesses whether a pattern of association across the group is evidence for correlated evolutionary change in the two characters. The method takes into account information on the lengths of the branches of phylogenetic trees, develops estimates of the rates of change of the discrete characters, and tests the hypothesis of correlated evolution without relying upon reconstructions of the ancestral character states. A likelihood ratio test statistic is used to discriminate between two models that are fitted to the data: one allowing only for independent evolution of the two characters, the other allowing for correlated evolution. Tests of specific directional hypotheses can also be made. The method is illustrated with an application to the Hominoidea.},

The method fits a continuous-time Markov model to a pair of traits, seeking the best fitting models that describe their joint evolution on a phylogeny. We employ the methodology of reversible-jump (RJ) Markov chain Monte Carlo to search among the large number of possible models, some of which conform to independent evolution of the two traits, others to correlated evolution. The RJ Markov chain visits these models in proportion to their posterior probabilities, thereby directly estimating the support for the hypothesis of corre- lated evolution. In addition, the RJ Markov chain simultaneously estimates the posterior distributions of the rate parameters of the model of trait evolution. These posterior distributions can be used to test among alternative evolutionary scenarios to explain the ob- served data. All results are integrated over a sample of phylogenetic trees to account for phylogenetic uncertainty. We implement the method in a program called RJ Discrete and illustrate it by analyzing the question of whether mating system and advertisement of estrus by females have coevolved in the Old World monkeys and great apes.},

  Abstract                 = {Scolytid bark beetles that colonize living conifers are frequently associated with specific fungi that are carried in specialized structures or on the body surface. These fungi are introduced into the tree during the attack process. The continuing association suggests that there is mutual benefit to the fitness of both beetles and fungi. The fungal species may benefit from the association with the beetles by transport to new host trees. Beetle species may benefit from the association with fungi by feeding on the fungi, or by the fungi contributing to the death of the host trees through mycelial penetration of host tissue, toxin release, interactions with preformed and induced conifer defenses, or the combined action of both beetles and fungi during colonization. Extensive research has been directed towards characterizing the interactions of beetle-fungal complexes with live host conifers and determining the ecological advantages for maintaining the associations. However, differences among systems and how species interact under different population and environmental conditions make it difficult to generalize about the importance of the separate biological components in successful host colonization.},

The species selected were Espina Corona (Gleditsia amorphoides (Griseb.) Taub), Gauyabi (Patagonula americana L.), Mora (Chlorophora tinctoria (L.) Gaud.) and Urunday (Astronium balansae Engl.). Espina Corona stands presented the highest contribution in total dry matter (13.5 kg ha(-1)); following in importance is Mora with 11.3 kg ha(-1) Guayaibi with 9.8 kg ha(-1) and Urunday with 8.8 kg ha(-1). Mora leaves accounted for 8.3\% of its total litter followed by Espina Corona with 8.1\%, Guayaibi with 3.8\% and Urunday with 2.8\%. The rate of decomposition leaf litter was estimated according to the Olson model (single exponential). The species which presented the greatest average annual decomposition rate was Mora with k = 0,28, significantly different (P less than or equal to 0.05) to Espina Corona with k = 0.16, and significantly different (P less than or equal to 0.05) to the third group composed by Urunday (k = 0.08) and Guayaibi (k = 0.04). Espina Corona, Guayaibi and Urunday experimental data suggest that the dynamics of litter decomposition may be better described by a double exponential model with a fast decomposable fraction and a more resistant one. Mora leaf litter followed a different pattern, fitting to the single exponential model. From the present study it may be concluded that a more active biogeochemical cycle can be established for Mora followed by Espina Corona, Urunday and Guayaibi, given that, a greater decomposition rate means less time of nutrient retention by the litter.

Individuals of 10 species with modes placed evenly along the dominant environmental gradient were randomly placed on these landscapes and were allowed to reproduce, disperse, and compete. The results demonstrate that the effect of a landscape's environmental variability on species coexistence is affected by the degree of spatial dependence in a complex manner. Increasing the fractal dimension (decreasing spatial dependence) allows more species to exist per microsite and per landscape. However, extremely high fractal dimensions cause fewer species to coexist on the landscape scale. Observed habitat breadths are increased (and beta diversity is decreased) as a function of D. I suggest that these patterns can be explained by habitat area, the mass effect, ecological equivalency, and global biological constraints.},

We determined allozyme diversity and population genetic structure for 12 populations of var. clausa and 9 populations of var. immuginata. At the species level, 88% of the 26 loci examined were polymorphic. The genetic diversity maintained at both the species (H-ES = 0.100) and population (H-ep = 0.092) levels was low, relative to most other pine species. Genetic differentiation among populations was also relatively low (G-ST = 0.054). Genetic distances between populations of the same variety (mean D = 0.006) were lower than genetic distances between populations of different varieties (mean D = 0.012). Although allele frequencies at individual loci differed significantly between the two varieties, each variety maintained nearly 99% of the genetic variation apparent at the species level (intervarietal differentiation, G-V = 0.014). The lower levels of genetic diversity in P. clausa may have resulted in part from genetic bottlenecks during periods of range retraction.},

  Abstract                 = {Ecological changes in the phenology and distribution of plants and animals are occurring in all well-studied marine, freshwater, and terrestrial groups. These observed changes are heavily biased in the directions predicted from global warming and have been linked to local or regional climate change through correlations between climate and biological variation, field and laboratory experiments, and physiological research. Range- restricted species, particularly polar and mountain top species, show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect interactions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming. Evolutionary adaptations to warmer conditions have occurred in the interiors of species' ranges, and resource use and dispersal have evolved rapidly at expanding range margins. Observed genetic shifts modulate local effects of climate change, but there is little evidence that they will mitigate negative effects at the species level.},

  Abstract                 = {Populations of south-western Australian members of the Restionaceae were examined in a wide range of wetland, seasonally inundated and dryland habitats over 4 years and the behaviour of 82 of the species authenticated according to whether they survived (resprouter strategy) or were killed (obligate seeder strategy) by fire. Material of the same seeder and resprouter species collected during summer or early autumn from habitats not burnt for at least 5 years was then used for morphometric measurements, observations on rhizome morphology, determinations of culm: rhizome dry weight (DW) ratios and assays of starch and sugars in rhizomes. Rhizome diameters of all 37 resprouters exceeded 2.3 mm while 28 of the 45 seeder species had narrow rhizomes in the range 0.2-2.1 mm. Culm : rhizome DW ratios of seeders (mean 12.3 +/- s.e. 1.2) were much higher than those of resprouters (mean 2.9 +/- s.e. 0.4). Mean +/- position of perennating buds of seeders was mostly at or close to soil surface (-0.6 +/- 0.2 cm), while that of resprouters was more deeply buried ( 2.8 +/- s.e. 0.5 cm), Seven categories of rhizome morphology were recognised. Three of these (essentially tufted habit, rhizome growth ascending or erect) were much more typical of seeders (n = 37) than resprouters (N = 5). The other four categories included rhizomes of, basically horizontal growth and a loosely tufted or widely spreading habit, and were collectively associated more with resprouters (n = 32) than seeders (n = 8). Starch was present at detectable levels in rhizomes of 23 species of resprouters (mean concentration +/- s.e. DW for these positive species was 7.13 +/- 1.62%) and only 3 seeders (0.16 +/- 0.11%). Levels of total soluble sugars (mean +/- s.e. DW) (predominantly sucrose, fructose and glucose) were 3.39 +/- 0.59% in resprouters compared with 1.06 +/- 0.19% in seeders. Data are discussed in relation to previous studies on seeder and resprouter representatives from other plant families.},

  Abstract                 = {The two main assembly processes claimed to structure plant communities are habitat filtering and competitive interactions. The set of species growing in fire-prone communities has been filtered. in such a way that species without fire-persistence traits have not successfully entered the community. Because plant traits are evolutionarily conserved and. re traits are correlated with other plant traits, communities under high. re frequency should not include all possible trait combinations, and thus the morphospace occupation by species in these communities should be lower than expected by chance (underoccupied). In contrast, communities under low. re frequency would lack the filtering factor, and thus their underoccupation of the morphospace is not expected. We test this prediction by comparing the morphospace occupation by species in communities located in the western Mediterranean Basin, five of them subject to high. re frequency (HiFi) and four to low. re frequency (LowFi). We first compile a set of morphological and functional traits for the species growing on the nine sites, then we compute the morphospace occupation of each site as a convex hull volume, and finally, to assert that our results are not a product of a random branching pattern of evolution, we simulate our traits under a null model of neutral evolution and compare the morphospace occupation of the simulated traits with the results from the empirical data. The results suggest that, as predicted, there is a clear differential morphospace occupation between communities under different. re regimes in such a way that the morphospace is underoccupied in HiFi communities only. The simulation of a neutral evolutionary model does not replicate the observed pattern of differential morphospace occupation, and thus it should be attributed to assembly processes. In conclusion, our results suggest that. re is a strong community assembling process, filtering the species that have fire-persistent traits and thus assembling phenotypically and phylogenetically clustered communities with vacant zones in the morphospace.},

  Abstract                 = {Introduced plants tend to experience less herbivory than natives, although herbivore loads vary widely. Herbivores may switch hosts onto an introduced plant for at least two reasons. They may recognize the novel plant as a potential host based on similarity of the plant's traits to the traits of one of its native hosts, a similarity that may or may not exhibit phylogenetic signal. Alternatively, herbivores may feed optimally, assessing which introduced plants provide the best nutrition irrespective of similarity to native species. Here, we created a phylogeny of 57 oak (Quercus) taxa, which were grown outside of their ranges in a common botanical garden that contained one abundant native oak (Quercus lobata). We used the phylogeny to estimate the phylogenetic conservatism of herbivory by two feeding guilds of insects (leaf chewers and leaf miners) and 11 plant traits expected to affect herbivore performance. We found high phylogenetic signal in chewing damage but not mining damage and all traits except for leaf maturation time. Introduced oaks that are more closely related to the native oak received more chewing and mining damage than distantly related oaks, and introduced oaks that had greater overall similarity in leaf traits also received higher chewing damage but not mining damage. These results demonstrate that interactions between introduced plants and their herbivores are driven independently by traits that track plant phylogeny and leaf traits that likely affect herbivore performance.},

  Abstract                 = {The effect of the spatial distribution of trees and foliage on understory conditions was examined in six tall old-growth forests along the Pacific Coast: two sites each in Washington, Oregon, and California. Detailed field measurements of crown parameters were collected on over 9000 trees encompassing over 14.5 ha in the stands. Crown parameters were used to construct a spatially explicit model useful in analyzing the variability of crown distributions in both vertical and horizontal dimensions. Sapwood measurements of over 400 trees in combination with published equations and 240 hemispherical photos were used to assess leaf area and understory light levels, respectively. Shrub and herb cover was used as a biological indicator of growing conditions in the understory. Although leaf area is often assumed to be correlated with the amount of light penetrating the canopy, this is not the case in tall, old-growth forests. The semivariance of the horizontal distribution of canopy volume was strongly correlated with shrub cover and understory light levels and was an overall predictor of canopy structure. This variability gives rise to potentially higher understory light levels and shrub cover values when compared with a forest lacking this vertical heterogeneity and may allow the stand to support a higher volume of foliage.},

  Abstract                 = {Methods are presented to relate temperature-residence-time at the soil surface, i.e., time above 150 degrees C as an estimation of the severity of a fire,, with measurements made during an experimental fire or on two past hoc measurements. The experiment was carried out in a shrubland dominated by the woody-legume Cytisus striatus subsp. eriocarpus, in Central Spain. Temperature-sensitive paints, and steam-releasing open-calorimeters were used as fire-meters during the burn. Post hoc measurements used were estimations of heat output per unit area, and measurements of the minimum diameter of branches of Cytisus remaining after the fire. Time above 150 degrees C was obtained from measurements made with thermocouples placed at the soil surface in 20 contiguous 1 x 1 m squares of the burn plot. All other measurements were made at each 1 x 1 m in the 22 x 3 m rectangle surrounding, and including, the thermocouple squares. Various simple and multiple regression models were constructed to predict time above 150 degrees C from each of the four measurements made during or after the fire. Maximum coefficients of determination obtained for regressions were 0.61 and 0.62 for water mass loss from open-calorimeters and branch diameter, respectively. Using all the variables in a multiple regression model, time above 150 degrees C was related to water mass loss from open-calorimeters and heat output per unit area with a coefficient of determination of 0.77. It is concluded that estimations of time above 150 degrees C at the soil surface during the passage of fire may be possible based on simple devices, such as open-calorimeters, or on biological indicators, such as minimum branch diameters. Additionally, combining two methods (open-calorimeters, estimations of heat output per unit area) may allow the reconstruction of the time above 150 degrees C during the fire at a scale of 1 m(2), an important characteristic of a burn to understand ecosystem response to fire.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Changes in biodiversity can affect ecosystem processes through a variety of pathways, such as changes in community structure, loss of a keystone or changes in resource use patterns among species. The latter, also known as resource use complementarity, is an established mechanistic link between species and ecosystems. 2. At present, functional group richness is the dominant measure of the extent of resource use complementarity and has been manipulated in several experiments. These groups are constructed a priori using information about differences between species and a statistically significant effect is typically identified by standard parametric tests. These tests implicitly assume that the a priori functional groups are correct. 3. Avoiding this assumption requires a randomization (bootstrap) test of statistical significance that accounts for the effects of grouping per se. This test compares the observed test statistic to the distribution of the test statistic resulting from random assignment of species to groups. 4. Re-analyses of experimental manipulations of plant functional diversity by bootstrapping the critical significance value changed the ecological interpretation of results in nearly half of the experiments. This occurred because random assignment of species to functional groups frequently creates a strong relationship between functional diversity and ecosystem functioning. 5. The significant bootstrapped results that were found perhaps represent some of the most convincing evidence that functional diversity is an important determinant of local-scale ecosystem functioning. }

  Abstract                 = {Functional diversity is an important component of biodiversity, yet in comparison to taxonomic diversity, methods of quantifying functional diversity are less well developed. Here, we propose a means for quantifying functional diversity that may be particularly useful for determining how functional diversity is related to ecosystem functioning. This measure of functional diversity "FD" is defined as the total branch length of a functional dendrogram. Various characteristics of FD make it preferable to other measures of functional diversity, such as the number of functional groups in a community. Simulating species' trait values illustrates how the relative importance of richness and composition for FD depends on the effective dimensionality of the trait space in which species separate. Fewer dimensions increase the importance of community composition and functional redundancy. More dimensions increase the importance of species richness and decreases functional redundancy. Clumping of species in trait space increases the relative importance of community composition. Five natural communities show remarkably similar relationships between FD and species richness. }

  Abstract                 = {An individual-based. spatially explicit stochastic lattice model, CAPS, was designed to examine multiple processes responsible for spatial patterns of abundance and diversity of sessile species in heterogeneous landscapes. Species simulated by CAPS differ in habitat preferences (niche width), dispersal of propagules, and relative fecundity. The spatial distribution of habitat types are represented as heterogeneous gridded landscapes. The outcome of competition and establishment processes in successive generations is determined locally via a seed lottery. A series of 200 year-long simulations was performed to investigate the effects of variation in species characteristics and competition, landscape heterogeneity, and disturbance on patterns of species abundances. The outcome of competition was most sensitive to differences in fecundity between species, the spatial distribution of suitable habitat and the initial distribution of species. Species with a narrow niche were confined to a single habitat type and remained at or near their initialization sites. Broader niches resulted in increasing niche overlap and competition but enhanced species mobility, allowing abundance levels to approach expected values determined by map resources. Even so, initial distributions still affected the spatial patterns of species distributions at year 200. Disturbance regimes were simulated by varying the frequency. extent and spatial pattern of disturbances. Disturbance events removed species from affected sites but did not other-wise alter habitat characteristics. Results showed that disturbances may lead to a reversal in competition and establishment, dependent on species-specific differences in fecundity and dispersal. Although intermediate levels of disturbance frequency and extent increased the probability of species coexistence, the spatial pattern of disturbance played an unexpectedly important role in the tradeoff between dispersal and fecundity. The ability to simulate multiple factors affecting patterns of persistence, abundance and spatial distribution of species provided by CAPS allows new insight into the temporal and spatial patterns of community development.

  Abstract                 = {Factors affecting ignition thresholds of the litter layer of shrubland vegetation were investigated using reconstructed litter beds in a laboratory. The factors investigated were fuel moisture content (FMC), litter type (primarily species), pilot ignition source, and wind. Litter beds made from 11 different litter types were ignited with point ignition sources. Litter from Allocasuarina nana (Sieber ex Spreng.) L. A. S. Johnson was used as the standard type across all experiments. Successful ignition was defined as fire spreading a fixed distance from the ignition point. Ignition success was modelled as a logistic function of FMC. Litter type had a major effect on ignitibility. The bulk density of the litter bed and the surface area of litter per volume of litter bed provided reasonably good predictors of the effect of litter type on ignition success. Low-density litter beds ignited at higher FMCs than dense litter beds. The two densest litter beds failed to ignite with the procedures used here. The ignition sources tested had significantly different effects on ignition success. Larger ignition sources were able to ignite wetter fuels than smaller sources. The presence of wind was found to have a different effect on ignition success depending on the location of the ignition source with respect to the litter bed. Wind decreased ignition success when the ignition source was located on top of the litter bed, but aided ignition when the ignition source was located within the litter bed.},

  Abstract                 = {Fire-prone shrub-dominated vegetation communities cover a considerable portion of Australia, including areas fringing urban development. Near urban interfaces, they are actively managed with prescribed fire to reduce the risk of wildfire (unplanned fire). Knowledge of the range of conditions that allow fires to spread or fail to do so is limited and can inconvenience fire managers when conducting prescribed burns. A series of experimental ignitions conducted in miniature shrublands reconstructed in the laboratory were used to investigate factors that influence ignition thresholds. The miniature shrublands were composed of foliage from the shrub Allocasuarina nana and were prepared over a range of moisture contents and densities. The impact of dead fuel within the aerial structure of the shrubs was also investigated, as was the presence and absence of wind and litter. The most important factors for spread initiation were identified using logistic regression analysis and classification tree modelling. The presence of litter, live fuel moisture content, shrub-layer density, presence of wind, and the amount and continuity of the dead elevated fuel were all found to influence spread sustainability. There was a negative interaction between shrub- layer density and live fuel moisture content, showing the effect of density to be less at higher moisture contents.},

  Abstract                 = {Phylogenetic relationships in Rosaceae were studied using parsimony analysis of nucleotide sequence data from two regions of the chloroplast genome, the matK gene and the trnL-trnF region. As in a previously published phylogeny of Rosaceae based upon rbcL sequences, monophyletic groups were resolved that correspond. with some modifications, to subfamilies Maloideae and Rosoideae, but Spiraeoideae were polyphyletic. Three main lineages appear to have diverged early in the evolution of the family: 1) Rosoideae sensu stricto, including taxa with a base chromosome number of 7 (occasionally 8); 2) actinorhizal Rosaceae, a group of taxa that engage in symbiotic nitrogen fixation; and 3) the rest of the family. The spiraeoid genus Gillenia, not included in the rbcL study, was strongly supported as the sister taxon to Maloideae sensu lato. A New World origin of Maloideae is suggested. The position of the economically important genus Prunus and the status of subfamily Amygdaloideae remain unresolved.},

This study examines variation in woody plant species composition in relation to a suite of environmental variables (i.e., elevation, potential soil moisture, soil type, geologic substrate, and heat load) in the Chiricahua National Monument, Arizona (CHIR). Nine vegetation types were identified using cluster analysis that varied by species composition and plant life form. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and correlation analyses identified significant relationships between vegetation composition and elevation, potential soil moisture, and heat load. Rarefied species richness varied among vegetation types, and in relation to topography, with higher species richness occurring on more topographically complex sites. beta (species turnover) and gamma (landscape) diversity were also high in CHIR compared to other temperate forests. This study highlights the importance of local- and landscape- scale environmental controls on species diversity and vegetation patterns in Madrean evergreen woodlands.},

  Abstract                 = {A conceptual model of Douglas-fir bark beetle (Dendroctonus pseudotsugae) dynamics and associated host tree mortality across multiple spatial and temporal scales was developed, then used to guide a study of the association between the occurrence of beetle-killed trees and factors that might render trees more susceptible to attack. Longterm records of beetle kill showed that beetle epidemics were associated with windstorms and drought at statewide and local spatial scales. At the landscape scale, beetle kill was associated with (i) portions of the landscape that were potentially drier (southern aspects, lower elevations) and (ii) portions of the landscape that had more mature and old-growth conifer vegetation. The patches of beetle-killed trees were aggregated with respect to other patches at scales of approximately 1 and 4 km. At the scale of the individual tree, there was not a strong relationship between beetle kill and resistance to attack measured by tree growth rate prior to attack. Our results show that landscape-scale phenomena and temporal patterns were more strongly correlated with beetle-kill events than was recent growth history at the scale of individual trees. We suggest that the multi-scale approach we employed is useful for elucidating the relative roles of fine- versus coarse-scale constraints on ecological processes.},

  Abstract                 = {We used pairs of congeneric shrub species from contrasting habitats to test for repeated evolutionary divergence in leaf-stem allometry and shoot hydraulic architecture in response to water availability. Allometric relationships and mean ratios between leaf size (individual and total area and mass per shoot) and stein cross-sectional area were compared between habitats using six species pairs representing three genera (Arctostaphylos, Baccharis, Ceanothus). We measured correlations among evolutionary changes in allometric. morphological, and physiological traits using phylogenetic independent contrasts. Allometric analysis revealed habitat differences: slopes were homogeneous among species (= 1.46), but the more mesic-adapted species generally supported more leaf area at a common stem cross-sectional area. Reducing bivariate allometry to a ratio obscured this pattern because ratios varied with stem size, which was unrelated to habitat. Mean individual leaf size also was not correlated with either water availability or leaf stem allometry. Stem hydraulic conductivity was generally lower in the xeric-adapted species of each pair, and its evolution mirrored changes in shoot allometry. This study provides evidence for repeated evolutionary divergence in shoot allometry and hydraulic architecture associated with water availability and demonstrates the importance of shoot allometry to water relations, independent of leaf size.},

  Abstract                 = {The use of the independent contrast method in comparative tests is studied. It is assumed that: (i) the traits under investigation are subject to natural selection; (ii) closely related species are similar because they share many characteristics of their niche, inherited from a common ancestor; and (iii) the current adaptive significance of the traits is the focus of investigation. The main objection to the use of species values in this case is that third variables which are shared by closely related species confound the relationship between the focal traits. In this paper, I argue that third variables are largely not controlled by the contrast methods, which are designed to estimate correlated evolution. To the extent that third variables also show correlated evolution, the true relationship among the traits of interest will remain obscured. Although the independent contrast method does not resolve the influence of third traits it does, in principle, provide a greater resolution than the use of the species mean values. However, its validity depends on the applicability of an evolutionary model which has a substantial stochastic component. To illustrate the consequences of relaxing this assumption I consider an alternative model of an adaptive radiation, where species come to fill a fixed niche space. Under this model, the expected value for the contrast correlation differs from that for the species correlation. The two correlations differ because contrasts reflect the historical pattern of diversification among species, whereas the species values describe the present-day relationships among the species. If the latter is of interest, I suggest that assessing significance based on the species correlations can be justified, providing that attention is paid to the role of potentially confounding third traits. Often, differences between contrast and species correlations may be biologically informative, reflecting changes in correlations between traits as an adaptive radiation proceeds; contrasts may be particularly useful as a means of investigating past history, rather than current utility of traits.},

Management records were used to examine the role of post-fire age, fire frequency and intensity, as well as biotic interactions (competition from overstorey proteoids and alien plants) in influencing vegetation composition over this time period. The mean similarity in species composition of sites between surveys was 62%, indicating an average of nearly 40% turnover in species over the 30 year period. The main causes of this change included differences resulting from different stages in the post-fire succession as well as the impact of differential fire regimes (especially frequency effects). Competition from serotinous Proteaceae, which proved highly mobile after fire, as well as invasive Australian acacias also impacted on the composition of the,vegetation over time. The study demonstrated that fynbos communities are temporally dynamic and that the changes over time in species composition are caused by a variety of processes. The study also provided evidence for the role of temporal diversity in contributing to the high species diversity in fynbos systems.},

Responses included seed germination, survival, biomass, and fecundity. Transplants into recently burned patches generally had higher survival, larger biomass, and greater reproductive output than transplants into long-unburned patches. Open areas and sites near oaks frequently were more favorable than sites near Florida rosemary. Ground lichens did not affect germination but increased mortality rate of seedlings. Neighboring small shrubby and herbaceous species did not affect the performance of these species. Of the three species, naturally occurring E. cuneifolium were farthest from large shrubs, and their microhabitats had the least ground lichens and shrubs. Eryngium cuneifolium and H. cumulicola are capable of forming persistent seed banks and their recruitment after fire depends mostly on these dormant seeds. Polygonella basiramia relies on seed dispersal and immediate seed germination to colonize recently burned patches. Management for these species should involve variable fire regimes to allow all three species to persist along with many other scrub endemics.},

The effects of adaptive radiation are often seen(4-6), but the underlying causes are difficult to disentangle and remain unclear(7-9). Here we examine directly the role of ecological opportunity and competition in driving genetic diversification. We use the common aerobic bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens(10), which evolves rapidly under novel environmental conditions to generate a large repertoire of mutants(11-13). When provided with ecological opportunity (afforded by spatial structure), identical populations diversify morphologically, but when ecological opportunity is restricted there is no such divergence. In spatially structured environments, the evolution of variant morphs follows a predictable sequence and we show that competition among the newly evolved niche-specialists maintains this variation. These results demonstrate that the elementary processes of mutation and selection alone are suifficient to promote rapid proliferation of new designs and support the theory that trade-offs in competitive ability drive adaptive radiation(14,15).},

To provide benchmarks and indicators for monitoring genetic changes due to recent and future bottleneck events and to assist development of conservation strategies, we assessed genetic diversity and structure of six small, isolated white pine populations from two regions at the limits of its geographical range in Newfoundland for comparison with three populations from its central range in Ontario for 20 allozyme loci coding for 12 enzymes. On average, 47.8% of the loci were polymorphic, the number of alleles per locus was 1.75, and the observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.215 and 0.195, respectively. Although most of the alleles were widespread, unique alleles were found in three of the nine populations examined. The Newfoundland populations were as genetically variable as those from Ontario. Generally, all populations exhibited slight excess of heterozygotes at most loci. Only 6.1% of the detected genetic variation was among populations, and the remainder among individuals within populations. The genetic distances among the populations within a province or region were as great as those among populations between the provinces or regions. Canonical discriminant functions and cluster analysis from genetic distances separated nine populations into the same four groups. Neither provincial nor regional or geographic gradient-related patterns of population variation and differentiation were apparent. It appears that 8000 years of postglacial geographic isolation and recent population decline have had little or no detectable effect on genetic diversity or differentiation of disjunct Newfoundland white pine populations from their ancestral mainland populations. Assuming their adaptability, the Ontario seed sources may be acceptable for white pine restoration in Newfoundland.},

Using an one-dimensional space, we present the model and dissect its parameters. Also, we test the ability of the model to simulate richness in complex two-dimensional domains and to fit real patterns in species richness, using South American Tyrannidae as an example. We found that a mid-spatial peak in species richness arises spontaneously under conditions of high environmental tolerances and/or a weak environmental gradient, since this condition causes wide species' geographic ranges, which are constrained by domain's boundary and tend to overlap in the middle. Our model was also a good predictor of real patterns in species richness, especially under conditions of high environmental strength and small species' tolerance. We conclude that this kind of spatial simulation models based on species' physiological tolerance may be an important tool to understand the evolutionary dynamics of species' geographic ranges and in spatial patterns of species richness.},

  Abstract                 = {A persistent question in the evolution of life histories is the fitness trade-off between reproducing only once (semelparity) in a lifetime or reproducing repeated times in different seasons (iteroparity). The problem can be formulated into a research agenda by assuming that one reproductive strategy is resident (has already evolved) and by asking whether invasion (evolution) of an alternative reproductive strategy is possible. For a spatially nonstructured system, Bulmer (1994) derived the relationship nu + P-A < 1 (P-A is adult survival; nu b(S) and b(S) are offspring numbers for iteroparous and semelparous breeding strategies, respectively) at which semelparous population cannot be invaded by an iteroparous mutant. When the inequality is changed to nu + P-A > 1, invasion of a semelparous mutant is not possible. From the inequalities, it is easy to see that possibilities for evolutionary establishment of a novel reproductive strategy are rather narrow. We extended the evolutionary scenario into a spatially structured system with dispersal linkage among the subunits. In this domain, a rare reproductive strategy can easily invade a population dominated by a resident reproductive strategy. The parameter space enabling invasion is far more generous with spatially structured evolutionary scenarios than in a spatially nonstructured system.},

  Abstract                 = {A small-variance approximation technique for examining the evolution of reproductive effort is developed, using a decomposition of fitness into arithmetic mean and variance components. Trait values often translate nonlinearly into fitness components such as offspring number or growth rate. A nonlinear relationship between phenotypic traits and fitness implies that the expected value of the fitness component will be a function of the arithmetic mean and variance in the traits influencing a given fitness component. The maximum expression of traits is often, however, a function of reproductive effort. Reproductive effort then influences the mean and variance in traits that affect fitness. Consequently, we can use these techniques to determine the optimal allocation of resources to current reproduction via their effects on the distribution of trait values. The optimal pattern of allocation is influenced by the quality and variability of the habitat and by the curvature of the trait-fitness relationship. The full range of adaptive responses, from semelparity to different degrees of iteroparity, can be predicted from the model. We extend the model to cases where reproductive effort can be partitioned into different offspring types, for example, offspring produced through chasmogamous and cleistogamous flowers. When more than one type of offspring is produced, then reproductive risks can be spread across offspring types and the conditions favoring semelparity are less restrictive. Semelparity is especially favored if the offspring types exhibit negative covariance in their contributions to growth rate. This new technique appears generally consistent with traditional life history theory, but can lead to some new insights that result from the explicit partitioning of the effects of central tendency and variability in trait-fitness relationships.},

  Abstract                 = {An individual host's likelihood of acquiring an infectious disease depends, in large part, on the location of the host relative to sources of infection, proximity to other hosts, and occupation of specific microhabitats that confer increased susceptibility. Spatial organization of the host and pathogen populations then may be critical in determining patterns of disease occurrence and dynamics. We discuss three fundamental problems associated with understanding the interactions of plants, pathogens, and spatial structure: (1) how one characterizes spatial patterns, (2) how we determine spatial dynamic processes from a given spatial pattern, and (3) how we then simulate the spatial dynamics presumed to be dominating a given host-pathogen interaction. To demonstrate methods for the characterization of spatial pattern, we analyzed spatial maps of a Silene latifolia population infected with the anther smut Microbotryum violaceum, using join-count statistics, continuous spatial autocorrelation, and Mantel's test. Different statistical techniques provided different interpretations of the same data set, indicating the value of using multiple methods. We described spatial structure in the plant population, the pathogen population (factoring out the plant population structure), and spatial cross correlation between two variables (plant gender and disease status). Each of these tests provides information on how the disease may be spreading in the population. We are not very optimistic about the prospect of determining underlying disease-spread processes purely from analysis of spatial pattern. Most spatial patterns can potentially be generated by a number of biological processes (e.g., ''true'' vs. ''apparent'' contagion), and it is not possible to distinguish between hypotheses without additional information about the system. A difficulty in modeling spatial processes is simulation of populations with given spatial patterns. Simulated spatially structured populations are useful for predicting disease dynamics in a spatial context.

  Abstract                 = {At a time when historical biogeography appears to be again expanding its scope after a period of focusing primarily on discerning area relationships using cladograms, new inference methods are needed to bring more kinds of data to bear on questions about the geographic history of lineages. Here we describe a likelihood framework for inferring the evolution of geographic range on phylogenies that models lineage dispersal and local extinction in a set of discrete areas as stochastic events in continuous time. Unlike existing methods for estimating ancestral areas, such as dispersal-vicariance analysis, this approach incorporates information on the timing of both lineage divergences and the availability of connections between areas (dispersal routes). Monte Carlo methods are used to estimate branch-specific transition probabilities for geographic ranges, enabling the likelihood of the data (observed species distributions) to be evaluated for a given phylogeny and parameterized paleogeographic model. We demonstrate how the method can be used to address two biogeographic questions: What were the ancestral geographic ranges on a phylogenetic tree? How were those ancestral ranges affected by speciation and inherited by the daughter lineages at cladogenesis events? For illustration we use hypothetical examples and an analysis of a Northern Hemisphere plant clade (Cercis), comparing and contrasting inferences to those obtained from dispersal-vicariance analysis. Although the particular model we implement is somewhat simplistic, the framework itself is flexible and could readily be modified to incorporate additional sources of information and also be extended to address other aspects of historical biogeography.},

We present a graphical approach to exploring the relationship between cost assumptions and evolutionary inferences from character data. The number of gains and losses of a binary trait on a phylogeny can be plotted over a range of cost assumptions, to reveal the inflection point at which there is a switch from more gains to moro losses and the point at which all changes are inferred to be in one direction or the other. Phylogenetic structure in the data, the tree shape, and the relative frequency of states among the taxa influence the shape of such graphs and complicate the interpretation of possible permutation-based tests for directionality of change. The costs at which the most-parsimonious state of each internal node switches from one state to another can also be quantified by iterative ancestral-state reconstruction over a range of costs. This procedure helps identify the most robust inferences of change in each direction, which should be of use in designing comparative studies.},

Estimation of the fire interval (expected time between scar-registering fires at any location) by maximum likelihood is presented. Because fires spread, causing a lack of independence in scar registration at distinct sites, an overdispersed binomial model is used, leading to a two-variable quasi-likelihood function. From this, point estimates, standard errors, and approximate confidence intervals for fire interval and related quantities can be derived. Methods of testing for the significance of spatial and temporal differences are also discussed. A simple example using artificial data is given to illustrate the computational steps involved, and an analysis of real fire-scar data is presented.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes an improved statistical methodology for estimating historical forest fire frequencies from time-since-fire map data. Of particular interest is the question of estimating fire frequency in temporally distinct epochs. Unlike previous graphical and ad hoc methods, the new methodology is firmly grounded within the established statistical paradigm of likelihood inference. In addition, in contrast to earlier methods, it takes into account the fact that surviving stands which originated in earlier epochs, have been subject to different hazards of burning as they have lived through more recent epochs. Neglecting this fact leads to overestimates of the fire frequency in the more recent epochs. Procedures for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates and likelihood ratio confidence intervals for the fire frequency in each epoch are developed, along with a likelihood ratio test to assess whether the fire frequencies in distinct epochs were significantly different. This test is not strictly valid when the change points separating epochs are suggested from exploratory data analysis; rather it is developed assuming that change points are determined independently of the data. This distinction, which is necessary to avoid selection bias, has not been noted before. The fact that forest fire is a contagious process, with consequent spatial autocorrelation in time-since-fire observations, is taken into account through the use of an overdispersed model, with associated quasi-likelihood function. This aspect has been ignored, by and large, in previous analyses which have implicitly assumed independence of observations. An example is given in which the method is applied to published fire history data from the Kananaskis Valley. The results indicate that the previous analysis overestimated the fire frequency for the most recent epoch. The conclusions of other studies concerning temporal changes in fire frequency may need to be reconsidered.},

  Abstract                 = {The effects of logging on ecosystem sustainability are controversial. Surprisingly, existing data are inadequate to allow a comprehensive evaluation of logging effects on biodiversity, composition, and productivity since appropriate comparisons of stands of similar ages and differing disturbance histories are rare. We addressed this issue using a study of 2000 plots in 80 southern boreal forest stands in northern Minnesota, USA, wherein we contrasted naturally regenerated aspen (Populus tremuloides), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), and black spruce (Picea mariana) stands established following logging or the dominant natural disturbance, wildfire, for stands of two age classes (25-40 and 70-100 yr old). For young stands, those established postlogging had higher vascular plant diversity than those postwildfire. Otherwise, we found no evidence of differing species diversity (including canopy tree, shrub, herbaceous, and bryophyte species), composition, productivity, or nitrogen cycling, in forest stands of comparable age and forest type that originated after logging compared to after wildfire. These variables, however, differed significantly among forest types, with aboveground net primary productivity and plant species diversity generally higher in aspen than jack pine stands, even when growing on comparable soils, and lowest in black spruce. Although there is evidence that logging has increased the proportional landscape dominance by aspen, a forest type with higher diversity, nutrient cycling, and productivity than other types, our evidence refutes the idea that disturbance by logging has diminished stand-scale productivity or plant diversity in comparison to the common natural disturbance, wildfire.},

However, a lack of change in the slopes (z-values) of species-area curves indicates that proportional changes were independent of scale of observation below 400 m(2). Changes in species richness were predominantly driven by immigration, which was significantly related to fire severity. Survival of species present pre-fire was greater than local extinction, but neither was related to severity. 3 Species richness of trees increased at all scales but proportional increases were smaller at larger scales and slopes of species-area curves decreased after the fire. Local seedling recruitment increased species richness at small scales, but low rates of immigration due to dispersal limitation in most species limited increases at larger scales. 4 Directional changes in species richness of non-trees were not always consistent at fine scales but both absolute and relative changes were positive at scales >= 1 m(2) and increased with increasing scale. Slopes of species-area curves increased post-fire because localized patterns of immigration within plots resulted in little mixing of species at small scales but large changes in species richness at larger scales. 5 Fire in the southern Appalachians increases plant species richness within local communities, but rates of species turnover and patterns of beta diversity are maintained by local recruitment of tree seedlings at small scales and immigration of herb, shrub and vine species at larger scales. 6 Although decreased levels of competition after disturbance promote species coexistence at small scales, changes in species richness at larger scales are determined by the degree that the local community is linked to the species pool of the surrounding landscape through processes related to dispersal, particularly mass effects.},

Conventional ground survey methods were used to collect coordinates and near-ground vegetation heights at 347 ground checkpoints distributed under a range of canopy covers. These points were used to check the DTM accuracy. The mean DTM error was 0.22 +/- 0.24 m (mean +/- SD). DTM elevation errors for four tree canopy cover classes were: clearcut 0.16 +/- 0.23 m, heavily thinned 0.18 +/- 0.14 m, lightly thinned 0.18 +/- 0.18 m, and uncut 0.31 +/- 0.29 m.

  Abstract                 = {At fine spatial scales (0.1 - 10 m), chaparral communities have been shown to be strongly influenced by canopy-gap patterns, leading to periodicities in vegetation at 4 - 5 m spatial scales. Fine-scale variations in fire behavior and post-fire erosion can lead to changes in the patterning of viable seeds and nutrients and may alter the spatial patterning of post-fire chaparral communities. This study deals with the relationship among fire behavior, post-fire nutrient availabilities and vegetation patterns in a 1-yr old, post-fire Adenostoma fasciculatum chaparral community in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, USA. Variations in mineral soil exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg) and extractable phosphorus (PO4-P) were correlated with ash distribution. Cations and measures of ammonium and nitrate were also correlated with fire intensity, measured by the diameter of the smallest remaining A. fasciculatum twigs following fire. Fire intensity was correlated with the pattern of post-fire vegetation establishment based on first axis DCA scores. However, ash PO4-P was more highly correlated with sample DCA scores, local species richness and total cover (p < 0.01), suggesting that small-scale variations in PO4-P which correlate with ash distributions may be important in structuring this community. Two- and three-term local variance analysis revealed a maximum of pattern intensity in DCA first axis scores at 4 - 5 m intervals that likely corresponds to pre-fire canopy-gap patterns. However, total cover showed pattern at spatial scales of 8 - 10 m, and was correlated at this scale with patterns of ash distribution and fire intensity. Microtopographic patterns also occur at similar spatial scales. Microtopographic patterns appear important in determining post-fire plant nutrient and water distributions and, thereby, patterns of plant establishment. Thus, the scale and intensity of post-fire vegetation pattern may differ considerably from pre-fire conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {How local interactions influence both population and evolutionary dynamics is currently a key topic in theoretical ecology. We use a 'well-mixed' analytical model and spatially explicit individual-based models to investigate a system where a population is subject to rare disturbance events. The disturbance can only propagate through regions of the population where the density of individuals is sufficiently high and individuals affected by the disturbance die shortly after. We find that populations where individuals are sessile often exhibit very different dynamic behaviour when compared to populations where individuals are mobile and spatially well mixed. When mutations are allowed which affect either offspring birth rates or mortality rates, the well-mixed populations always evolve to a state where a single disturbance event leads to extinction. Populations often persist substantially longer if individuals are sessile and they disperse their offspring locally. We also find that for sessile populations selection may favour short-lived individuals with limited offspring production. Population dynamics are found to be strongly influenced by the host characters that are evolving and the rate at which host variation is introduced into the system.},

  Abstract                 = {The question of which factors limit the occurrence of a plant species to a particular site is addressed by considering 53 cases in which the distribution of pines (Pinus species; Pinaceae) has changed in the last century. We consider expansions of pines in and adjacent to their natural ranges in the Northern Hemisphere and the spread from sites of introduction in the Southern Hemisphere well outside the contemporary range of pines. We first consider a neutral hypothesis (with respect to climate or biological interactions as determinants of invasion): invasion simply requires that a species is present in sufficient numbers, with sufficient propagules over sufficient time to invade. We then explore the relative importance of climatic changes, disturbance, competition (including competition between seedlings and herbaceous plants during early establishment), herbivory, pathogens, and other agents that might influence pine membership in communities. Determinants of susceptibility to invasion often interact in a complex fashion. Environmental stresses created by moisture and temperature appear to exercise primary control on invasibility at xeric and high-elevation sites, respectively, but play a smaller role at intermediate locations. At these sites, range limits are determined principally by interactions between pine seedlings and the resident biota in adjacent communities. This suggests that the effects of predicted global warming on the distribution of pines are unlikely to be simple functions of temperature or precipitation, except at climatic extremes. Pine invasions are most prevalent where there is limited competition in the regeneration niche and occur more easily in habitats where the dominant growth form is not different from that of pines, namely, in grasslands. The disturbance regime in the receiving habitat is important and interacts directly and indirectly with the "inherent" susceptibility to invasion. Severe disturbances may initiate pine invasions at any latitude, but are essential for reducing the cover of vigorous plant growth (and hence competition in the regeneration niche) in tropical and near-tropical regions. Contemporary practices such as deforestation and increased grazing pressure and those practices leading to accelerated erosion, modified fire regimes, and climate amelioration essentially duplicate ice-age stresses and disturbances that shaped plant communities in the Holocene. The fundamental role of biotic factors (either direct or indirect) in regulating the distribution of pines is discussed with reference to aspects of land husbandry including the management of biological invasions.},

During the past three decades, ecologists have sought to explain differences in local diversity by the influence of the physical environment on local interactions among species, interactions that are generally believed to limit the number of coexisting species. But diversity of the biological community often fails to converge under similar physical conditions, and local diversity bears a demonstrable dependence upon regional diversity. These observations suggest that regional and historical processes, as well as unique events and circumstances, profoundly influence local community structure. Ecologists must broaden their concepts of community processes and incorporate data from systematics, biogeography, and paleontology into analyses of ecological patterns and tests of community theory.},

  Abstract                 = {The influence of factors associated with fire on seed germination of Australian native species is generally well documented, but examples involving the use of smoke as a fire analogue for ecological research remain limited. The role of season of treatment in the efficacy of smoke as a promotive germination agent was investigated over two growing seasons using natural soil stored seedbanks in Banksia woodland near Perth, Western Australia. Smoke was applied to unburnt sites in the autumn, winter and spring of 1994. Germinant emergence and seedling survival of 37 species representing 18 families was monitored in both unburnt sites and in adjacent, recently burnt sites until the second spring after treatment (October 1995). Recruitment from seed was found to be profoundly affected by the season in which dormancy breaking treatment had been applied. The promotive effect extended beyond the initial year of application. For the majority of the species investigated, application of smoke to unburnt sites in autumn promoted a significantly greater germination response than treatment in winter or spring. In only three cases (introduced annuals, the Fabaceae and Hibbertia amplexicaulis) did autumn smoke treatment not yield better germination than in summer-burnt counterparts. However, in almost half of the cases examined, proportions of seedlings surviving past their first summer after emergence in burnt areas were consistently greater than those in smoked or untreated sites. Most notably, no seedlings emerging during the spring of the first year of study survived into the following summer. Implications of the results with respect to future seed bank research and management of native vegetation are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The effects of shoot damage on starch concentrations in large roots and lower boles of the tropical timber tree, Cedrela adorata, were measured over a 30-day period following mechanical shoot removal. The degree of damage was based on amounts typically destroyed by Hypsipyla grandella, a serious lepidopteran pest of C. odorata. From 14-month-old plantations at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, three treatments were established based on the length of shoot and number of leaves removed: controls (no tissue removed), moderate damage, and severe damage. Initial starch concentrations were compared with concentrations observed 18 to 30 days following shoot removal using enzymatic starch hydrolysis and colorimetry. Root starch concentrations increased in undamaged trees, decreased slightly in the moderately damaged trees, and decreased markedly in severely damaged trees during the sampling period. Starch concentrations in lower boles did not decrease following shoot damage, suggesting a specific role of root search reserves in responding to aboveground carbon requirements. The dry weights of regrown shoots were similar for the moderately and severely damaged trees, but severely damaged trees produced numerous basal shoots while moderately damaged trees produced only one or two terminal shoots near the point of excision. Decreases in root search concentrations following shoot damage and rapid shoot regrowth suggest that starch remobilization in roots of C. odorata might provide a survival mechanism after attack by H. grandella.},

  Abstract                 = {Coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don) Endl.) has long-lived individual trees that can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Allozyme markers indicate that, in old-growth populations in northern California, 15-34% of clones are multistemmed. Of those, they have few stems per clone, and none are very spatially pervasive. There is much variety in the clonal configurations observed, including circular, linear, and (or) disjunct arrangements. Visual assessment is a poor predictor of clonal identity and fairy ring structures more often than not contain multiple genotypes. In this first allozyme study of coast redwood, high levels of genetic variation are observed, higher than those observed for most other western conifers. These levels are perhaps related to the species' hexaploid condition, ancient phylogenetic lineage, and historically broader natural range. There are also generally high levels of genotypic diversity. Upland sites, with more frequent and intense fires, do not differ significantly in genotypic diversity from the more mesic lowland sites. Population structure in coast redwood seems to resemble the classic pattern for many open-pollinated conifers: much diversity within and little among populations. However, this is not a rangewide study. The current levels and structure of genetic and genotypic diversity in old-growth populations suggests episodic recruitment. The long-lived nature of individual stems and the capacity for asexual reproduction may allow clones to exist indefinitely, thus challenging some of the generalizations in evolutionary theory that are based on sexually reproducing species.},

This study compared starch values in pine root tissue extracted with either perchloric acid or starch-digesting enzymes. Three variations of the two extraction methods were tested. The accuracy of starch determination was assessed for five methods by comparing results to a standard method that employed perchloric acid and KI precipitation. Methods that employed commercial enzymes without additional purification yielded starch values slightly higher than the standard method. Commercial enzymes subjected to additional purification yielded starch values slightly lower than the standard method. Perchloric acid methods without KI precipitation yielded starch values 20-40% higher than the standard method. Also, enzyme methods had the higest precision for extraction and colorimetric steps and were more convenient than perchloric acid methods if additional enzyme purification was not performed. Detailed protocols for the laboratory procedures are provided.},

  Abstract                 = {This study explored the determinants of spread of four alien Pinus species and the ability of models to predict invasion dynamics in a complex fragmented landscape. The role of environmental factors, natural and anthropogenic disturbance in relation to invasion history was assessed for different stages in the invasion process using a Geographic Information System. Pines escaped from plantations over the past 30 years and spread into the natural semi-arid shrubland (renosterveld). The pattern of spread was compared with a simulated random distribution using two different techniques, a standard logistic regression, and a new recursive modelling approach (Formal Inference-based Recursive Modelling; FIRM). FIRM analysis improved the accuracy of predictions and revealed interactive effects of variables hidden by the logistic regression analysis. More than 80% of isolated pine individuals were found in 20% of the habitat classified as suitable by the models. Soil pH was the most important predictor for the distribution of isolated trees, whereas the establishment of dense pine stands was largely determined by fire history. Differences in invasive behaviour could be explained by species attributes such as limited dispersal for P. canariensis, and better drought-tolerance for P. halepensis. Sixty-five percent of the current pine distribution was accurately predicted by the spatial distribution of the first trees to have invaded. Such models could be used to predict potential spread of invasive plants and gain a better understanding of the main factors driving the invasion process. However, the spread of invasive species in fragmented landscapes, strongly modified by human activities, is very complicated, and the spread remains difficult to predict in the long term. The dynamics of invasion are discussed in relation to changes in land use and disturbance regime.},

  Abstract                 = {Jack pine is an important species for planting and direct, seeding in the Lake States (USA) and throughout much of the boreal forest of Canada. It is highly variable in climatic adaptation, growth, and form and exhibits great genetic diversity of silvicultural significance. Within its natural range jack pine grows in diverse climatic conditions and on a wide variety of sites. Planting of jack pine in the past was largely on sites too poor to support merchantable timber production of other species. Planting jack pine on the poorest sites was not always justifiable. On short rotations and good soil, locally adapted jack pine produces a higher volume of wood than do red pine or other sympatric species. Nearly all the present range of jack pine was glaciated during the most recent Wisconsin stage. Thus, the present distribution of the species results from reinvasion and migration over great distances in a short time. Jack pine is monoecious with ovulate cones usually occurring in the upper tree crown and staminate cones in the lower crown. Staminate cone primordia are initiated in early or mid-July and ovulate cone primordia in Aug. Time of wind-pollination varies from year to year, occuring within the period from mid-May to mid-June. Two growing seasons are required for the ovulate cones to mature. The seed is mature and viable in mid-Sept. of the 2nd growing season. Cone and seed production is fairly regular and increases until crowns begin to compete. Over much of its range, jack pine has serotinous, persistent cones, allowing seed to be stored on the tree for several years while retaining its viability. Little seed dormancy is present, and germination is usually rapid. Cuttings taken from young trees cna be rooted, but rooting ability decreases rapidly as the ortet age increases. Needles fascicles, in which the intrafascicular buds are forced to develop by shearing the terminal bud, can also be rooted. Grafting is highly successful in some clones, but graft incompatibility is evident in others. Cell culture and tissue culture have not yet resulted in successful propagation of a complete jack pine tree.},

  Abstract                 = {Low-elevation ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Doug]. ex. Laws.) forests of the northern Rocky Mountains historically experienced frequent low-intensity fires that maintained open uneven-aged stands. A century of fire exclusion has contributed to denser ponderosa pine forests with greater competition for resources, higher tree stress and greater risk of insect attack and stand- destroying fire. Active management intended to restore a semblance of the more sustainable historic stand structure and composition includes selective thinning and prescribed fire. However, little is known about the relative effects of these management practices on the physiological performance of ponderosa pine. We measured soil water and nitrogen availability, physiological performance and wood radial increment of second growth ponderosa pine trees at the Lick Creek Experimental Site in the Bitterroot National Forest, Montana, 8 and 9 years after the application of four treatments: thinning only; thinning followed by prescribed fire in the spring: thinning followed by prescribed fire in the fall; and untreated controls. Volumetric soil water content and resin capsule ammonium did not differ among treatments. Resin capsule nitrate in the control treatment was similar to that in all other treatments, although burned treatments had lower nitrate relative to the thinned-only treatment. Trees of similar size and canopy condition in the three thinned treatments (with and without fire) displayed higher leaf-area-based photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and mid-morning leaf water potential in June and July, and higher wood radial increment relative to trees in control units. Specific leaf area, mass-based leaf nitrogen content and carbon isotope discrimination did not vary among treatments. Our results suggest that, despite minimal differences in soil resource availability, trees in managed units where basal area was reduced had improved gas exchange and growth compared with trees in unmanaged units. Prescribed fire (either in the spring or in the fall) in addition to thinning, had no measurable effect on the mid-term physiological performance and wood growth of second growth ponderosa pine.},

This structure, as imaged seismically, is roughly cylindrical in shape with a diameter of 100 km, and extends to similar to225 km depth. Centered above this structure is a region similar to120 km in diameter that is undergoing active subsidence relative to adjacent regions. Such subsidence is seen in the active fluvial-alluvial sediment flooding of mountainous topography of the southwestern Sierra and in the development of the adjacent Tulare Lake basin of the San Joaquin Valley. Dynamic modeling of such upper-mantle drip structures predicts a phase of overlying surface subsidence during the most vigorous phase of drip formation. The southern Sierra upper mantle drip and the overlying crust appear to be in this phase of their dynamically coupled evolution.},

  Abstract                 = {In a classical paper, Hutchinson (1961) argued that the large number of species in most plankton communities is remarkable in view of the competitive exclusion principle, which suggests that in homogeneous, well-mixed environments species that compete for the same resources cannot coexist. Few ideas in aquatic ecology have evoked more research than this 'paradox of the plankton'. This review is an effort to put the main solutions to the paradox that have been proposed over the years into perspective. Hutchinson himself already suggested that the explanation could be that plankton communities are not in equilibrium at all due to weather-driven fluctuations. Subsequent research confirmed that such externally imposed variability can allow many species to coexist. Another important point is that in practice the homogeneous well-mixed conditions assumed in the competitive exclusion principle hardly exist. Even the open ocean, for instance, has a spatial complexity resulting from meso-scale vortices and fronts that can facilitate coexistence of species. Perhaps most excitingly, theoretical work on species interactions has given a counter-intuitive new dimension to the understanding of diversity. Various competition and predation models suggest that even in homogeneous and constant environments plankton will never settle to equilibrium. Instead, interactions between multiple species may give rise to oscillations and chaos, with a continuous wax and wane of species within the community. Long-term laboratory experiments support this view. This chaotic behavior implies among other things that plankton dynamics are intrinsically unpredictable in the long run when viewed in detail. Nonetheless, on a higher aggregation level, indicators such as total algal biomass may show quite regular patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {We studied plant survival and colonization over an experimental gradient, from fire lightly scorching the soil to fire consuming most of the organic soil layer, at two forest sites in northern Sweden. The gradient was achieved by adding different amounts of fuel to small plots that were burned in 1988 and 1989. Temperature was recorded at four soil strata during burning. We analyzed survival of seeds and rhizomes in the soil immediately after fire, and followed vegetation cover and seedling establishment until 1993. During fire, there was a steep decline in maximum temperature with increasing depth below the char, irrespective of the depth of burn in the mor layer, indicating that burn depth can be used as a general indicator of heat impact below ground. Lethal temperature was not recorded deeper than 20-30 mm under the burn boundary. Plant survival was determined both by depth of burn and by depth distribution of regenerative structures in the soil. Three rhizomatous species, the dwarf shrubs Vaccinium myrtillus and Vaccinium vitis-idaea and the grass Deschampsia flexuosa, were dominant in the prefire vegetation. For all three species, the bulk of the soil bud bank was located within the mor layer, but was more superficial for D. flexuosa. Initial mortality in the bud bank was progressively higher with increasing depth of burn, and this determined the regrowth over the following years. After fires that consumed only the moss layer, cover of the Vaccinium species returned to prefire levels within 2-4 yr, and D. flexuosa showed a dramatic increase in cover as well as in fruiting. Fires that burned slightly deeper nearly eliminated D. flexuosa, and the deepest burning fires also eliminated Vaccinium spp. In contrast to regrowth from rhizomes, colonization from seed was better after relatively deep-burning fire, both for species with a soil seed bank and for species dispersing seed onto the burnt soil. However, after fires consuming most of the organic soil layer, seed bank species were also badly affected, whereas dispersers showed progressively better establishment with increasing depth of burn. Differences between treatments were still great after 5 yr, indicating that variation in depth of burn will have a long-lasting impact on the vegetation. These results from experimentally burned plots were corroborated by an analysis of depth distribution of viable plant rhizomes and seeds, and the initial colonization at a site newly burned in a wildfire. The precise response patterns of boreal vegetation to variation in burn depth will depend on characteristics of the species present. However, we assume that these results have a high degree of generality, since, in podzolized soils, most rhizomatous species are predominantly located in the mor layer, since the dormant seed bank typically is concentrated at the interface of mor and mineral soil, and also since a thick organic soil layer is a poor seedbed for incoming seeds. The results indicate that in boreal forest, depth of burn is a more important variable than fire front intensity for the understory vegetation, in contrast to the situation in ecosystems with little accumulation of organic material on the mineral soil.},

These theories are testable by ''reconstructing'' ancestor states using phylogenetic trees and measurements of contemporary species. Here we use maximum likelihood to estimate and evaluate the accuracy of ancestor reconstructions. We present likelihoods of discrete ancestor states and derive probability distributions for continuous ancestral traits. The methods are applied to several examples: diets of ancestral Darwin's finches; origin of inquilinism in gall wasps; microhabitat partitioning and body size evolution in scrubwrens; digestive enzyme evolution in artiodactyl mammals; origin of a sexually selected male trait, the sword, in platies and swordtails; and evolution of specialization in Anolis lizards. When changes between discrete character states are rare, the maximum likelihood results are similar to parsimony estimates. In this case the accuracy of estimates is often high, with the exception of some nodes deep in the tree. If change is frequent then reconstructions are highly uncertain, especially of distant ancestors. Ancestor states for continuous traits are typically highly uncertain. We conclude that measures of uncertainty are useful and should always be provided, despite simplistic assumptions about the probabilistic models that underlie them. If uncertainty is too high, reconstruction should be abandoned in favor of approaches that fit different models of trait evolution to species data and phylogenetic trees, taking into account the range of ancestor states permitted by the data.},

  Abstract                 = {To mitigate erosion after fire, land managers often seed non-native grasses onto burned slopes. To assess how post-fire seeding affects plant recovery, we compared areas that were either unseeded or artificially seeded after high-intensity fire in a dry Abies grandis (Dougl.) Lindl. forest in the northeastern Cascades. Seeding with a mix of non-native grasses and a legume significantly reduced the cover of native plants and shifted patterns of relative abundance after 2 years. Although seeding did not significantly affect total cover or native species richness, it reduced overall native plant cover by 47%. Species that recolonize via wind-dispersed seeds (e.g., Epilobium angustifolium L., Lactuca serriola L., and Arenaria macrophylla Hook.), species with long-lived seeds that germinate after fire (e.g., Ceanothus velutinus Dougl.), and species with wide successional amplitudes that resprout after fire (e.g., Apocynum androsaemifolium L. and Salix scouleriana Barratt) all declined steeply in cover on seeded plots. In addition, conifer seedlings were only half as abundant on seeded plots. As seeding after fire does not boost total plant cover and limits conifer tree establishment on the study area, it appears to do little to reduce the risk of soil erosion. It also appears to inhibit native shrub and herb re-establishment. These substantial effects on native species appear to alter plant communities well beyond the life of the seeded species.},

  Abstract                 = {Fire may act as a selective force on plants both through its direct effects by killing or wounding susceptible individuals and through its effect on the environment: the post-fire environment may select specific physiological traits or life histories. We used phylogenetic independent contrasts to test the hypothesis that fire has selected for correlated evolution among alternative suites of traits in pines: a survival/avoidance suite characterized by thick bark, height, and self pruning of dead branches; and a fire-embracing strategy in which plants invest little into survival, exhibit traits which enhance flammability, and use fire as a means to cue seedling establishment to the post-fire environment through serotinous cones. We created a set of alternative "supertree" phylogenies for the genus Pinus from published sources. Using these alternative phylogenies, published ecological data for 38 pine species (Keeley and Zedler 1998), and newly collected morphological data, we demonstrate that much variation in trait evolution occurs along a fire surviving/fire embracing axis. Pines vary in their susceptibility to ignition since a tree that retains dead branches is more likely to carry a fire into the canopy than a tree that self-prunes. The evolution of increased flammability may have altered evolutionary trajectories prompting an evolutionary switch from a fire-surviving to a fire-embracing life history. Alternatively, the fire-embracing strategy may in fact select for increased flammability to ensure canopy ignition and the realization of serotinous seed-release.},

  Abstract                 = {The intermediate disturbance hypothesis is a widely accepted generalization regarding patterns of species diversity, but may not hold true where fire is the disturbance. In the Mediterranean-climate shrublands of South Africa, called fynbos, fire is the most importance disturbance and a controlling factor in community dynamics. The intermediate disturbance hypothesis states that diversity will be highest at sites that have had an intermediate frequency of disturbance and will be lower at sites that have experienced very high or very low disturbance frequencies. Measures of diversity are sensitive to scale; therefore, we compared species richness for three fire regimes in South African mountain fynbos to test the intermediate disturbance hypothesis over different spatial scales from 1 m-2 to 0.1 hectares. Species diversity response to fire frequency was highly scale-dependent, but the relationship between species diversity and disturbance frequency was opposite that predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. At the largest spatial scales, species diversity was highest at the least frequently burned sites (40 years between fires) and lowest at the sites of moderate (15 to 26 years between fires) and high fire frequency (alternating four and six year fire cycle). Community heterogeneity, measured both as the slope of the species-area curve for a site and as the mean dissimilarity in species composition among subplots within a site, correlated with species diversity at the largest spatial scales. Community heterogeneity was highest at the least frequently burned sites and lowest at the sites that experienced an intermediate fire frequency.},

In contrast, north facing slopes had approximately the same number of shrubs burned by low and high fire intensity fires (24 versus 19, respectively). We only found seedlings under shrubs burned by low intensity fires and most of them were of A Muehlenbeckia hastulata and Trevoa trinervis. Also viable seeds were only found under shrubs burned by low intensity fires.

This provides a scaling from plant traits to ecological communities while bypassing the complications of population dynamics. Our method treats community development as a sorting process involving species that are ecologically equivalent except with respect to particular functional traits, which leads to a constrained random assembly of species; the relative abundance of each species adheres to a general exponential distribution as a function of its traits. Using data for eight functional traits of 30 herbaceous species and community-aggregated values of these traits in 12 sites along a 42-year chronosequence of secondary succession, we predicted 94\% of the variance in the relative abundances.},

  Abstract                 = {Eight natural populations of Pinus nigra ARN. occurring on the Crimean peninsula were investigated by starch-gel electrophoresis. A total of 70 alleles were observed at 24 loci. Interpopulation genetic diversity was about 2% of the total genetic diversity. NEI's genetic distance coefficient ranged from 0.005 to 0.022 among populations and averaged 0.012. The level of gene flow was 18.98 migrants per generation. The results of the analysis of gene diversity, genetic differentiation and gene flow demonstrated that the P. nigra populations studied had similar genetic structures. Estimated parameters of genetic variation showed that in P. nigra more than 66% of loci were polymorphic and the mean expected and observed heterozygosity values were 0.248 and 0.241, respectively, which allowed to regard the P. nigra as one of the most highly variable members of the genus Pinus.},

  Abstract                 = {(1) To study the population-level effects of fire on the savanna grass Andropogon semiberbis, sized-classified matrix population models were constructed for an annually burnt population and for a population protected from fire. These models were used to examine the effects of fire on population growth rate, stable size distributions and reproductive value, and to simulate different fire regimes. (2) The burnt population is capable of increasing rapidly (.LAMBDA.1 = 1.2524, r = 0.2251), whereas the unburnt, population is unable to persist (.lambda.1 = 0.2762, r =- 1.2886). Most of this difference is due to effects on the growth, survival and reproduction of the smallest two size classes, which are shown by elasticity analysis to be the most important to population growth in both populations. The stable size distributions and reproductive values are similar in the two populations. (3) Both deterministic and stochastic analyses reveal a critical frequency of fire (.apprxeq. 0.85) below which this species is unable to maintain itself. This apparent reliance on fire frequency suggests that the spread and evolution of this species has been closely related to human occupation of neotropical savannas.},

  Abstract                 = {Thinning and burning treatments based on forest conditions present before Euro-American settlement have been proposed to improve growth of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) in northern Arizona. We examined tree growth response to different levels of such treatments and compared growth response between old trees that established before Euro-American settlement (presettlement trees) and younger trees that established after Euro-American settlement (postsettlement trees). We made these comparisons for 3 years of posttreatment growth in northern Arizona stands subjected to four levels of thinning. Thinning treatments varied the number of postsettlement trees retained to replace dead presettlement trees. Thinning increased radial growth at breast height of postsettlement trees in all 3 years after treatment, and growth response was negatively correlated with posttreatment stand basal area. In contrast, growth of presettlement trees was not affected by thinning in most years, and there was no relationship between growth and posttreatment stand basal area. Application of the same thinning prescription to stands with different management history resulted in different posttreatment basal area and consequently different growth response to thinning for postsettlement trees. Our results show that growth of 80-year-old, postsettlement ponderosa pines is more responsive to restoration thinning than older presettlement trees, and provide guidelines for thinning levels needed to stimulate growth of presettlement trees.},

  Abstract                 = {Thinning and burning treatments based on presettlement (prior to Euro-American settlement) stand conditions have been proposed for improving the vigor and growth of Pinus ponderosa. No study has examined effects of different levels of such thinning treatments on tree water, carbon, and nitrogen relations, or compared effects between postsettlement (trees established after Euro-American settlement) and presettlement (established before Euro-American settlement) trees. We investigated responses of presettlement and postsettlement trees to three levels of thinning and burning (unthinned/unburned control, light thinning/burning, heavy thinning/burning) over 2 yr that differed in precipitation in northern Arizona. Both thinning treatments consistently increased predawn water potential of both tree sizes compared with the control. Effects of thinning on leaf gas exchange varied between tree sizes and measurement times. Thinning increased net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance only when soil water availability was lowest, and increases were greater for postsettlement than presettlement trees. In contrast, thinning had no effect on foliar nitrogen concentration. \ Our results suggest greater positive effects of restoration thinning on tree water and carbon relations for postsettlement versus presettlement trees, and under drought versus nondrought conditions. Photosynthetic response to thinning in old trees may be constrained by physiological factors associated with large size such as low soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance.},

  Abstract                 = {Ecologists have often compared ecological communities in different areas, for example on different continents. The main interest is that the communities might be more similar in the characters of their species than expected under a null model of random species assortment. We suggest that such a null model should be based only on the species observed across the samples. Species-level convergence and community-level convergence must be distinguished. Physical filters (limitation to growth by the physical environment) can give species-level convergence, but only biotic filtering (based on species interactions) can give community-level convergence. Matching to species and species mutual matching must also be distinguished; the process is different, but the same tests work for both. Evolutionary convergence and ecological convergence have been distinguished in the past, but there is little value in this distinction. Even if evolutionary character separation is occurring, the selection involved must be based on ecological sorting, by elimination of genotypes that are too similar. Although ecotypes can be distinguished, the results of evolution by whole species are impossible to distinguish, by present-day observation, from those of ecological sorting. Fortunately, tests for present-day evidence of evolution also work for ecological sorting, and vice-versa. Contrary to suggestions that community convergence is untestable, valid tests do exist, They have already produced some evidence of convergence, but evidence that community-level convergence is a common and general phenomenon remains to be produced. }

  Abstract                 = {We classified NALC (North American Landscape Characterization) imagery to forest-nonforest and examined forest change between 1972 and 1992 in the Klamath-Siskiyou ecoregion ( USA) in relation to land ownership and fifth level watersheds. We also analyzed changes in forest patterns by land ownership for three major river basins within the ecoregion (Eel, Klamath, and Rogue) using FRAGSTATS. Overall, forests covered 66.8% of the ecoregion in 1972 and 62.1% in 1992. Approximately 10.5% of the forest area was disturbed overall, translating into an annual disturbance rate of 0.53%. Although public lands accounted for a slightly higher total area of forest disturbance, private lands were cut at a slightly higher rate. Forest disturbance within fifth level watersheds averaged 13.2%, but reached as high as 93.2%. For the three river basins where spatial pattern of forest disturbance was analyzed, private lands were already more fragmented than public lands in 1972. Over the 20-year time period, forest fragmentation increased on all ownerships. Fragmentation rates on public lands were high for all basins especially the Rogue. Clearcut logging on private lands was generally in larger adjacent tracts, whereas cuts on public lands were generally smaller and more dispersed. Our results illustrate the importance of considering landscape change history when planning for effective biodiversity conservation in forested ecoregions and when formulating ecologically sustainable forest management strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {Forest-fire policy of U.S. federal agencies has evolved from the use of small patrols in newly created National Parks to diverse policy initiatives and institutional arrangements that affect millions of hectares of forests. Even with large expenditures and substantial infrastructure dedicated to fire suppression, the annual area burned by wildfire has increased over the last decade. Given the current and future challenges of fire management, and based on analytical research and review of existing policies and their implications, we believe several changes and re-emphases in existing policy are warranted. Most importantly, the actual goal of fuels-management projects should be the reduction of potential fire behavior and effects, not the simple. reduction of fuels. To improve safety and economic efficiency, fire-suppression policies should recognize differences in the characteristics of wildfires, and strategies should be tailored to better respond to the unique demands of each fire. Where forest fires are burning large areas, as in the western United States, reducing the trend of increased amounts of burned area may require a diversity of treatments, including prescribed burning, mechanical fuels treatment, and increased use of the Wildland Fire Use Policy. Assessment of how fire is affecting forests would be enhanced if land-management agencies reported the area burned by low-, mixed-, and high-severity fire and what proportion is outside the desired trend or range of conditions for each forest type. Congress should provide an improved budgetary process for fire and fuels management, with a larger annual federal fire-suppression budget. Additionally, reducing annual area burned will require long-term coordinated efforts by federal and state governments, with robust partnerships between land-management agencies and the public in collaborative planning and stewardship. Research and adaptive management are essential in allowing fire-hazard-reduction projects to move forward where proposed projects are met with uncertainty and mistrust. While legislative reform may be desirable, a strategy that is not entirely dependent on new legislation is needed. Building on existing programs that are consistent with a science-based strategy will enable land-management agencies to better utilize information in pursuit of the overall objective of reducing uncharacteristically severe wildfires.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last two decades, although much has been learned regarding the multifaceted nature of biodiversity, relatively little is known regarding spatial variation in constituents other than species richness. This is particularly true along extensive environmental gradients such as latitude. Herein, we describe latitudinal gradients in the functional diversity of New World bat communities. Bat species from each of 32 communities were assigned to one of seven functional groups. Latitudinal gradients existed for the richness, diversity and scaled-dominance of functional groups. No significant patterns were observed for evenness of functional groups. Measures of functional diversity were different in magnitude and increased towards the equator at a faster rate than expected given the underlying spatial variation in species richness. Thus, latitudinal gradient in species richness alone do not cause the latitudinal gradient in functional diversity. When variation in species composition of the regional fauna of each community was incorporated into analyses, many differences between observed and simulated patterns of functional diversity were not significant. This suggests that those processes that determine the composition of regional faunas strongly influence the latitudinal gradient in functional diversity at the local level. Nonetheless, functional diversity was lower than expected across observed sites. Community-wide responses to variation in the quantity and quality of resources at the local level probably contribute to differences in functional diversity at local and regional scales and enhance beta diversity.},

Rapid incision of similar to0.2 mm/yr from 2.7 to ca. 1.5 Ma slowed markedly to similar to0.03 mm/yr thereafter, likely reflecting the combined effects of a transient erosional response to Pliocene rock uplift and periodic mantling of riverbeds with glacially derived sediment in the late Quaternary. While similar to400 m of incision has occurred in the past 2.7 m.y., outpacing interfluve erosion and thereby increasing the local relief, canyons as deep as 1.6 km existed prior to that time. These new erosion rates strengthen the case for tectonically driven late Cenozoic uplift.},

Treatment areas were selected by fire managers from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) based on the threat of fire to communities and the need for range and wildlife improvement. Afire density grid was derived from the BLM's fire start layer to identify historically high ignition areas. FireFamily Plus was used to summarize and analyze historical weather and calculate seasonal severity and percentile reports. Information from FireFamily was used in FARSITE and FlamMap to model pre- and post-treatment effects on fire growth, spotting, fireline intensity, surface flame length, and the occurrence of crown fire. This procedure provides managers with a quantitative measure of treatment effectiveness as well as spatial output that can be used for analyzing fuel treatment effectiveness, burn plan development, National Environmental Policy Ad (NEPA) documentation, public education, etc.},

Don), bishop pine (P. muricata D. Don), and knobcone pine (P. attenuata Lemm.). Total genomic DNA was digested with four restriction endonucleases and probed with a 750-bp fragment of the mitochondrial coxI gene amplified from P. attenuata via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The coxI gene is repeated at least 4 times in some populations, and all variants that we observed resulted from complex rearrangements rather than from point mutations. There was limited intrapopulation variation, but strong differentiation among populations. When applied to haplotype frequencies, Nei's gene diversity within populations (H(s)) averaged 7 % (+/- 3), and G(st) varied from 75 % for P. radiata to 96% for P. muricata. The high degree of population differentiation for mtDNA suggests that it can be a powerful marker of population differences, but its rapid rate of structural evolution appears to result from recombination among a limited number of repetitive elements-giving frequent homoplasious fragment phenotypes. The phylogenetic trees disagreed with results from chloroplast DNA, nuclear gene, and morphological studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Predicting ecosystem responses to global change is a major challenge in ecology. A critical step in that challenge is to understand how changing environmental conditions influence processes across levels of ecological organization. While direct scaling from individual to ecosystem dynamics can lead to robust and mechanistic predictions, new approaches are needed to appropriately translate questions through the community level. Species invasion, loss, and turnover all necessitate this scaling through community processes, but predicting how such changes may influence ecosystem function is notoriously difficult. We suggest that community-level dynamics can be incorporated into scaling predictions using a trait-based response–effect framework that differentiates the community response to environmental change (predicted by response traits) and the effect of that change on ecosystem processes (predicted by effect traits). We develop a response-and-effect functional framework, concentrating on how the relationships among species' response, effect, and abundance can lead to general predictions concerning the magnitude and direction of the influence of environmental change on function. We then detail several key research directions needed to better scale the effects of environmental change through the community level. These include (1) effect and response trait characterization, (2) linkages between response-and-effect traits, (3) the importance of species interactions on trait expression, and (4) incorporation of feedbacks across multiple temporal scales. Increasing rates of extinction and invasion that are modifying communities worldwide make such a research agenda imperative.},

  Abstract                 = {A randomized complete block experiment was performed to measure the effect of prescribed, dormant-season bums of three different levels of severity (measured as fuel consumption and soil surface heating) on subsequent insect infestation and mortality of mature longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.). Multiple-funnel traps baited with a low release rate of turpentine and ethanol were used to monitor activity of certain coniferophagous beetles. Non-aggressive species, including the root beetles Hylastes salebrosus Eichhoff and H. tenuis Eichhoff, the ambrosia beetle Xyleborus pubescens Zimmermann, the reproduction weevil Pachylobius picivorus (Germar), and buprestid borers, were attracted to burned plots in numbers that correlated positively with burn severity. Beetle attraction to burned sites was greatest in the first weeks post-bum and disappeared by the second year. Two potential tree-killing bark beetles, Dendroctonus terebrans (Olivier) and Ips grandicollis (Eichhoff), were trapped in significant numbers but exhibited no attraction to burned plots. Tree mortality correlated significantly with the severity of the bums and amounted to 5% of stems in the hottest bum treatment after 3 years. The majority of the mortality was observed in the second and third years post-bum. Attacks of Ips and Dendroctonus bark beetles were apparent on nearly all dead or dying trees, and evidence suggested that root pathogens may have contributed to tree susceptibility to beetle attack and mortality. Our data indicate that selection of bum regimes that reduce or eliminate consumption of duff (e.g., favoring heading fires over backing fires) could significantly reduce mortality of longleaf pine managed for long rotations.

  Abstract                 = {Litter production, standing crop of litter on forest floor and leaf- litter decomposition of selected dominant tree species were studied in the tropical forests at Kodayar in the Western Chats, India. Mean annual litterfall in the study sites ranged from 5.63 to 8.65 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). A greater amount of annual Litter production was observed in sites II and III, when compared to sites I and IV. This variation in litterfall pattern among the sites could be attributed to species composition. Monthly variation in Litterfall pattern showed two peaks, one in the dry season (January-April) and another in November. Contribution of leaf litter to the total litter was significantly (p < 0.01) greater compared to other components (woody litter and reproductive parts). In deciduous forests, Terminalia contributed significantly (p < 0.05) greater amount of leaf litter to annual litter production, followed by Careya arborea, Macaranga peltata, Aporosa lindleyana and Dillenia pentagyna, whereas in evergreen forests, Hopea parviflora contributed the most. The results suggest that species composition and their contribution toward litter becomes important in overall community or site litter production as observed in sites II and III. The litter mass decreased linearly with time. Thin and smooth leaf without prominent skeletal tissues decomposed more rapidly, while thick and tough leaves with prominent midribs and veins took longer time for complete decomposition. The species with high nitrogen content exhibited relatively faster decomposition except in H. parviflora and V. indica. The differences in decay rates and half-life periods are related to structure and nutrient concentration of leaf litter and the environmental factors. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

  Abstract                 = {Predictions of ecological response to climate change are based largely on direct climatic effects on species. We show that, in a California grassland, species interactions strongly influence responses to changing climate, overturning direct climatic effects within 5 years. We manipulated the seasonality and intensity of rainfall over large, replicate plots in accordance with projections of leading climate models and examined responses across several trophic levels. Changes in seasonal water availability had pronounced effects on individual species, but as precipitation regimes were sustained across years, feedbacks and species interactions overrode autecological responses to water and reversed community trajectories. Conditions that sharply increased production and diversity through 2 years caused simplification of the food web and deep reductions in consumer abundance after 5 years. Changes in these natural grassland communities suggest a prominent role for species interactions in ecosystem response to climate change.},

  Abstract                 = {Older chaparral stands are frequently characterized by gaps in the canopy and by a lack of herbaceous vegetation in these openings. Many causes for the lack of herb growth in gaps have been postulated, including lack of seeds in the soil, limited nutrients and water, competition with shrubs for resources, interference competition (i.e., allelopathy), and herbivory. An experiment was conducted to assess the individual and combined effects of four main factors (trenching to reduce root competition, caging to reduce herbivory, nutrient addition, and water addition) on herb germination,survival, and growth in chaparral dominated by chamise, Adenostoma fasciculatum. We found strong interactions among these treatments. Therefore, no single factor can be regarded as causing the absence of herbs in chaparral. Herb establishment was limited by herbivory and root competition with shrubs for limited nutrients and/or water. Survival was enhanced by trenching, caging, and water. Growth was enhanced by nutrient addition, but the magnitude of this nutrient effect became appreciable only within trenched, caged plots. The vegetative cover of annual herbs in gaps was limited by the combined effects of herbivory, competition with the roots of shrubs, inadequate nutrients, and inadequate water.},

A highest heterozygosity was observed in populations Strzalowo, Milomlyn, Bolewice and Babki, originating from the areas known as the most abundant in valuable pine stands in Poland. Southern populations considered as the most poorly growing in Poland, were in most cases much less heterozygous.},

  Abstract                 = {Small-scale variation in fire intensity and effects may be ail important source of environmental heterogeneity in frequently burned plant communities. We hypothesized that variation in fire intensity resulting from local differences in fuel loads produces heterogeneity in pine savanna ground cover by altering shrub abundance. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally manipulated prefire fuel loads to mimic naturally occurring fuel-load heterogeneity associated with branch falls, needle fall near large pines, and animal disturbances in a frequently burned longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) savanna in Louisiana, USA. We applied one of four fuel treatments (unaltered control, fine-fuel removal, fine-fuel addition, wood addition) to each of 540 (1-m(2)) quadrats prior to growing-season prescribed fires in each of two years (1999 and 2001). In both years fuel addition increased (and fuel removal decreased) fuel Consumption and maximum fire temperatures relative to unaltered controls. Fuel addition, particularly wood, increased damage to shrubs, increased shrub mortality, and decreased resprout density relative to controls. We propose that local variation in fire intensity may contribute to maintenance of high species diversity in pine savannas by reducing shrub abundance and creating openings in an otherwise continuous ground cover.},

In deserts, local-scale differences in environmental productivity may be caused by the presence of shrubs, which represent a favorable habitat for annual populations within a nutrient-poor matrix. In this study, we attempted to test the hypothesis that facilitation of desert annuals by shrubs increase the intensity of competition among the annual plants. Such negative indirect effects have so far been ignored in studies about plant-plant interactions. We tested our hypothesis by measuring seedling survival and fecundity of four abundant annual plant species with and without neighbors in open areas and under shrub canopies in a sandy desert area. Our findings did not indicate indirect negative effects of shrubs on their understory annuals. Sensitivity to the presence of neighbors varied between species and surprisingly, the species with the smallest seeds was the only one which was not negatively affected by the presence of neighbors. In contrast to our hypothesis, there was no difference between the habitat types shrubs and openings in absolute and relative competition intensity. Our overall results suggest that negative indirect effects of shrubs are unimportant in determining demographic response of understory annual plants.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, numerous studies have pointed to the importance of positive interactions in natural communities. There is now a broad consensus that the balance between negative and positive interactions should shift along environmental gradients, with competition prevailing under environmentally benign conditions and positive interactions dominating under harsh conditions. A commonly cited example of the importance of facilitation in harsh environments is the preference of desert annual plants for the areas under the canopy of shrubs. The recognition of apparently positive effects of desert shrubs on annuals, however, has been mostly based on density measurements, while fitness parameters of the understory plants have been ignored. Also, the temporal consistency of such effects has not been previously tested. Based on conceptual ideas about the balance between interference and facilitation, we predicted that positive effects of the shrubs on the understory should dominate in dry years, while in favorable years, negative effects would be stronger. We tested our hypothesis by measuring the direction and magnitude of the shrub effect on demographic responses of four desert annual plant species during four consecutive seasons of differing rainfall. The results contradicted our initial hypothesis. Depending on the species, the effect of the shrubs shifted from either negative to neutral or from neutral to positive with increasing annual rainfall. However, this trend was stronger for the effect of shrubs on plant reproductive success than on their densities. Our data highlight the importance of measuring fitness parameters in studies of plant-plant interactions. We suggest that the negative effects of shrubs on plant fitness were due to rainfall interception, while positive effects were related to increased nutrient availability beneath shrubs. However, the mechanisms by which the shrubs and annuals interact can only be resolved using an experimental approach. Our results contradict previous hypotheses about the relative importance of positive and negative interactions along environmental gradients. A simple conceptual model summarizing the proposed role of rainfall in determining the direction of shrub effects on their understory annuals is presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Plant species composition, species abundances, and species richness were strongly recruitment limited in a 4-yr experiment in which seeds of up to 54 species were added to patches of native grassland. Four field seasons after a one-time addition of seed, many added species were still present and reproducing, with plots seeded at the highest rate having species richness that was 83% greater and total plant cover that was 31% greater than controls. Total plant community cover increased significantly with the number of species added as seed, but total cover of pre-existing species was independent of the number of species added as seed, suggesting that the new species mainly filled previously ''empty'' sites. The proportion of added species that became established was negatively correlated with initial species richness of plots, suggesting that species-rich sites were more resistant to invasion. Plot invasibility also depended on the abundances and species richness of plant functional groups in the plots, but was independent of seed size and of total plant cover. The major functional groups of plants differed in their abilities to invade as seed, with perennial grasses being the poorest invaders and herbaceous legumes being the best. Thus, local biotic interactions and recruitment dynamics jointly determined diversity, species composition, and species abundances in these native grassland communities. This supports a metapopulation-like perspective over a purely interspecific-interaction perspective or a purely regional perspective, suggesting that recruitment limitation may be more important, even on a local scale, than often recognized.},

  Abstract                 = {Human-caused environmental changes are creating regional combinations of environmental conditions that, within the next 50 to 100 years, may fall outside the envelope within which many of the terrestrial plants of a region evolved. These environmental modifications might become a greater cause of global species extinction than direct habitat destruction. The environmental constraints undergoing human modification include levels of soil nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium and pH, atmospheric CO2, herbivore, pathogen, and predator densities, disturbance regimes, and climate. Extinction would occur because the physiologies, morphologies, and life histories of plants limit each species to being a superior competitor for a particular combination of environmental constraints. Changes in these constraints would favor a few species that would competitively displace many other species from a region. In the long-term, the "weedy" taxa that became the dominants of the novel conditions imposed by global change should become the progenitors of a series of new species that are progressively less weedy and better adapted to the new conditions. The relative importance of evolutionary versus community ecology responses to global environmental change would depend on the extent of regional and local recruitment limitation, and on whether the suite of human-imposed constraints were novel just regionally or on continental or global scales.},

  Abstract                 = {We studied post-fire Pinus albicaulis Engelm. seedling establishment in the Sleeping Child and Saddle Mountain burns of western Montana 26 and 28 years, respectively, after fire. Pinus albicaulis seeds are dispersed primarily by Clark's nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana Wilson) in caches of 1-15 or more seeds. Consequently, P. albicaulis seedlings and trees often occur in clusters. In the Sleeping Child burn we collected regeneration data from 63 quadrats along a 3.6-km transect and from 14 quadrats along a 20.6-km road transect; in the Saddle Mountain burn we collected data from 41 quadrats along a 3.2-km transect. We determined regression models for height versus age and age versus height relationships for P. albicaulis and Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt. and used the latter regression models to construct regeneration age structures for both bums. For both conifers a disproportionately high percentage of regeneration was established between 1977 and 1985, about 17-25 years after fire. Thus, major regeneration was episodic. A small increase in mean seasonal rainfall between 1977 and 1985 possibly contributed to this recruitment surge. Age differences of 1-8 years occurred among seedlings in 65-86% of the seedling and tree clusters sampled, suggesting delayed germination of some cached seeds. Pinus albicaulis regeneration was more frequently associated with Vaccinium scoparium Leiberg and less frequently associated with Xerophyllum tenax (Pursh) Nutt. and Luzula hitchcockii Hamet-Ahti relative to the overall frequency of occurrence of these plants among quadrats.},

We had the opportunity to study changes due to recurring wildfires on the same sites over a period of 50 years in the ''Massif des Aspres'' (southern France). The study was carried out in areas occupied by Quercus suber and Q. ilex series. A comparison of historical and cartographical documents (vegetation maps covering a 50 year interval and an accurate map of major wildfires during this period) allowed us to determine the changes occurring over time with or without fire action. Plant communities were grouped into three main vegetation types: forests, treed shrublands and shrublands. The passage of three successive wildfires on the same site led to a decrease in forest areas and an increase in shrublands; however, shrublands were already present before the first fire of the period under consideration. Less frequent fire occurrence induced more complex heterogeneity and greater landscape diversity. In the study region as a whole, with or without fire action, a significant decrease in forest surfaces was recorded, whereas there was an increase of unforested communities such as treed shrublands and shrublands. In some parts of the Massif fires increased the homogeneity of the landscape, in other parts they created a greater heterogeneity and diversity of plant communities.},

  Abstract                 = {A stochastic theory of limiting similarity is presented that attempts to quantify the relationship between tolerable niche overlap among competing species and the degree of environmental fluctuation. The theory is based on a heuristic analytical approximation that provides conditions under which a rare invading species can increase in the presence of a community of established competitors. The major qualitative conclusion, derived from investigating two symmetric, discrete-time, stochastic analogs of the {Lotka-Volterra} competition equations, is that weak to moderate stochastic variation does not appear to limit significantly the similarity of competing species. This result is in sharp contrast to the conclusions of May and {MacArthur's} pioneering study of stochastic limiting similarity. A possible reason for this discrepancy is explored.},

  Abstract                 = { Causes and implications of spatial variability in postfire tree density and understory plant cover for patterns of aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and leaf area index (LAI) were examined in ninety 11-year-old lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm.) stands across the landscape of Yellowstone National Park (YNP), Wyoming, USA. Field studies and aerial photography were used to address three questions: (1) What is the range and spatial pattern of lodgepole pine sapling density across the burned Yellowstone landscape and what factors best explain this variability? (2) How do ANPP and LAI vary across the landscape and is their variation explained by abiotic factors, sapling density, or both? (3) What is the predicted spatial pattern of ANPP and LAI across the burned Yellowstone landscape? Stand density spanned six orders of magnitude, ranging from zero to 535,000 saplings ha(-1), and it decreased with increasing elevation and with increasing distance from unburned forest (r(2) = 0.37). Postfire densities mapped from 1:30,000 aerial photography revealed that 66% of the burned area had densities less than 5000 saplings ha(-1) and approximately 25% had densities greater than 10,000 saplings ha(-1); stand density varied spatially in a fine-grained mosaic. New allometric equations were developed to predict aboveground biomass, ANPP, and LAI of lodgepole pine saplings and the 25 most common herbaceous and shrub species in the burned forests. These allometrics were then used with field data on sapling size, sapling density, and percent cover of graminoid, forb, and shrub species to compute stand-level ANPP and LAI. Total ANPP averaged 2.8 Mg ha(-1) y(-3) but ranged from 0.04 to 15.12 Mg ha(-1) y(-1). Total LAI averaged 0.80 m(2) m(-2) and ranged from 0.01 to 6.87 m(2) m(-2). Variation in ANPP and LAI was explained by both sapling density and abiotic factors (elevation and soil class) (ANOVA, r(2) = 0.80); abiotic variables explained 51%-54% of this variation. The proportion of total ANPP contributed by herbaceous plants and shrubs declined sharply with increasing sapling density (r(2) = 0.72) and increased with elevation (r(2) = 0.36). However, total herbaceous productivity was always less than 2.7 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), and herbaceous productivity did not compensate for tree production when trees were sparse. When extrapolated to the landscape, 68% of the burned landscape was characterized by ANPP values less than 2.0 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), 22% by values ranging from 2 to 4 Mg ha(-1) y(-1), and the remaining 10% by values greater than 4 Mg ha(-1) y(-1). The spatial patterns of ANPP and LAI were less heterogeneous than patterns of sapling density but still showed fine-grained variation in rates. For some ecosystem processes, postfire spatial heterogeneity within a successional stage may be similar in magnitude to the temporal variation observed through succession.},

  Abstract                 = {Before 1800, frequent fires maintained Idaho fescue prairies and Garry oak woodlands on Fort Lewis. Fire exclusion in the 1900s, however, has allowed Scot's broom, Douglas fir,and numerous herbaceous aliens to invade native prairies and oak woadlands. Since 1978, a management program using prescribed fires on 3-5 yr rotations has been used in an effort to maintain the open communities. We evaluated the role of fire on fescue prairies, oak woodlands, and broom thickets using prescribed fires in fall 1994 and spring 1995, and compared preburn/postburn species frequency to identify fire maintainers, increasers, and decreasers. Fall fires were more effective than spring fires, and best promoted native species and communities. Prescribed fires had no effect on Idaho fescue frequency, which maintained dominance in the postfire prairie. Other native prairie graminoids and forbs, and hairy cats-ear, a prominent alien, were maintained by fire. Prescribed fires also maintained open Garry oak woodlands, reduced Scot's broom cover in broom thickets. and killed small Douglas-firs. These fires, however, tended to favor alien species instead of native species. A large prairie subjected to >50 yr of broadcast burns ignited annually by artillery fire has been converted from fescue prairie to an open meadow dominated by hairy cats-ear and alien grasses, such as sweet vernal grass. Of the three regimes we investigated, fire intervals shorter or longer than the 3-5 yr fire rotation now employed on Fort Lewis are detrimental to fescue prairie and oak woodland. Excessive burning or fire exclusion causes loss of prairie and oak woodland.},

  Abstract                 = {Zigadenus fremontii is often a striking component of the flora following fire in the chaparral. Like other geophytes, it produces large numbers of flowers in the first spring after a burn. Although these plants are most conspicuous in the early postfire environment, the question that remains is, how do they persist in the interval between fires? To address this we investigated differences in the growth and reproduction of Z. fremontii in burned and unburned chaparral. We monitored marked individuals for nine years at three sites: two that were burned in 1990 and one in the same area that was in unburned mature chaparral. We measured leaf area, and production of flowers and fruits. We also conducted seed experiments in the field to determine the rates and timing of germination. We found that reproduction occurs only in the immediate postfire period: flowering and production of fruits and seeds in the first year following fire, and seedling establishment by year 3. There was a cost of reproduction; plants that flowered (in the burn area) had negative growth rates the following year. In contrast, plants in unburned chaparral, which did not flower, had positive growth rates over the same period. Moreover, plants that produced the most flowers had the lowest growth rates. In the unburned chaparral site, plants were not dormant as predicted from previous literature; instead they produced leaves nearly every year. In most years the average leaf area per plant was greater than that in the burned sites. Our results indicate that postfire reproduction depends on growth and carbohydrate storage in the inter-fire period. We also suggest that this species is relatively long-lived for a herbaceous perennial.},

  Abstract                 = {The importance of a soil seed bank was evaluated through its role in the recovery of a burnt shrubland. The study was carried out in a heathland characterized by several ericaceous species. Part of the heathland was burnt in a wildfire on 7 April 1991, while the rest was not affected by the fire and used as a control. Soil samples were collected three days after the wildfire, in the absence of rain; 10 samples (20x25 cm width to a depth of 5 cm) were collected from the burnt area and 10 from the control. Samples were set out in a greenhouse where germinating seedlings were recorded, counted and identified for 17 months. Observations were also carried out twice in the field for 14 months after the wildfire by examining two permanent transects in the study area and recording all regenerating species. The results show a low correspondence between soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation: only 23% of the identified taxa appeared both in the bank and in the field observations. From these species 65% of them have dispersal types like autochory or barochory, that is they generally fall near the mother plant. In the identified species as a whole, therophytes and hemicryptophytes dominate in comparison with chamaephytes, phanerophytes and geophytes; this also applied to the herbaceous species in comparison with the woody ones. Potentially soil possesses an important seed bank, which contributes poorly to the vegetation recovery after fire.},

  Abstract                 = {A comparative study between an unburned evergreen sclerophyllous vegetation located in south-central Mexico under a wet-summer climate, with mediterranean regions was conducted in order to re-analyze vegetation and plant characters claimed to converge under mediterranean climates. The comparison considered floristic composition, plant-community structure, and plant characters as adaptations to mediterranean climates and analyzed them by means of a correspondence analysis, considering a tropical spiny shrubland as the external group. We made a species register of the number of species that resprouted after a fire occurred in 1995 and a distribution map of the evergreen sclerophyllous vegetation in Mexico (mexical) under nonmediterranean climates. The Tehuacan mexical does not differ from the evergreen sclerophyllous areas of Chile, California, Australia, and the Mediterranean Basin, according to a correspondence analysis, which ordinated the Tehuacan mexical closer to the mediterranean areas than to the external group. All the vegetation and floristic characteristics of the mexical, as well as its distribution along the rain-shadowed mountain parts of Mexico, support its origin in the Madrean-Tethyan hypothesis of Axelrod. Therefore, these results allow to expand the convergence paradigm of the chaparral under an integrative view, in which a general trend to aridity might explain floristic and adaptive patterns detected in these environments.},

In the Mediterranean Basin, it has also been hypothesized that regeneration strategy of plants after fire is associated with several other life history traits. This paper tests both hypotheses for the dominant plants in the Mediterranean Basin from literature data. Results show that seeders from the Mediterranean Basin grow significantly faster and allocate more biomass to leaf plus paracotyledons than resprouters. Seeders are mainly non-sclerophyllous, anemochorous, dry-fruited, small-seeded species that evolved in the Quaternary (post-Pliocene) and are associated with earlier successional stages. Resprouters are mainly sclerophyllous, vertebrate-dispersed, fleshy-fruited, large-seeded species that evolved in the Tertiary (pre-Pliocene) and are associated with late successional stages.},

  Abstract                 = {A widely-used description of vegetation response to fire is that species can be clearly classified as sprouters or non-sprouters. We aimed to assess: (1) how well this dichotomous classification (sprouter/non-sprouter) described the responses of a semi-arid flora to experimental disturbance; (2) how similar were sprouting responses to treatments mimicking intense herbivory and fire; (3) how well easily-measured traits could predict sprouting. Sprouting was assessed for 45 species from a range of growth forms (grasses, forbs, sub-shrubs, woody shrubs and trees) from semi-arid south-eastern Australia. We used two treatments: clipping at stem base, and clipping followed by burning with a blowtorch. A dichotomy accounted for >60% of deviance explained by species identity. Models with three or four groups were not substantially better. The dichotomy was not between 0% and 100% sprouting, rather between 'weak' and 'strong' sprouters. Probabilities of sprouting for weak sprouters were 23% after clipping and 6% after burning, while strong sprouters had sprouting probabilities of 90% after clipping and 79% after burning. While sprouting varied in space and time, the dichotomy was robust to this variation. Sprouting ability increased with size in most of the species with variable sprouting. Sprouting was partially related to growth form; grasses sprouted strongly, chenopods weakly, and forb and woody species covered the range of sprouting. Strong sprouters were likely to have more stems per plant, greater basal area, shorter potential height and deeper buds than weak sprouters. A hierarchical model that used growth form and then stems-per-plant provided a simple, robust predictor of sprouting. Four-fifths of species responded consistently to clipping and burning while one-fifth of species were strong sprouters after clipping but weak sprouters after burning. Burning reduced sprouting most in intermediate sprouters. Differences between sprouting after clipping and burning reflected increased intensity and were related to the depth of buds below ground.},

  Abstract                 = {Fires can mediate switches between alternative vegetation types which may be more flammable and thus reinforce fire spread. We tested if there is a positive feedback between the expansion of the tussock grass Ampelodesmos mauritanica (hereafter Ampelodesmos) and fire hazard in Mediterranean Basin communities and its relation to tree cover decline. The effect of fire on Ampelodesmos population structure was analysed by surveying stands burned at different fire frequencies. The effect of vegetation dominated by Ampelodesmos on fire behaviour compared to other species coexisting in the community was predicted by the Rothermel fire propagation model BEHAVE. There was a negative correlation between pine cover and percentage of Ampelodesmos plants. Ampelodesmos mortality after fire is very low. Recently burned stands had a higher proportion of reproductive plants and higher seedling density than unburned stands. The high temperatures reached during fire may kill seeds, the higher seedling recruitment results from fast resprouting and higher seed production of burned plants compared to unburned plants 1 year after fire. Simulations with the BEHAVE fire model predict that Ampelodesmos increases fire intensity and spread because of its high accumulation of fuel load and standing dead material. The results suggest that there is a positive relationship between Ampelodesmos abundance and fire regime which increases the invasive potential of this grass and the fire risk of the community where it dominates.

We review studies on plant competition in mediterranean-type plant communities in order to discuss its effect on plant- and plant community structure, to determine the type of competition that takes place and the interaction between competition and effects of fire. Competition can intermittently effect all stages of the plant life cycle. Water and light seem to be the most frequent resources for which plants compete. Competition for nutrients also occurs and seems to be more intense when nutrient availability is high. Plant interference through allelopathy is also important. Competition may also occur after fire but it is not clear if it is less intense than in mature stands. As most of the studies have been carried out in California. More field experiments that combine the effect of competition and fire along with environmental gradients differing in water and nutrient levels should be conducted in other mediterranean regions in order to draw generalizations on the mechanisms of competition in plant communities.},

Cuttings were planted in pots containing sand and grown in a controlled environment chamber in which seasons were artificially induced by changes in temperature and photoperiod. Nitrogen was supplied at optimum and low rates, and during dormancy, one-half of the plants were decapitated. Starch concentrations in root and stem tissues were determined regularly during shoot extension growth, dormancy and resprouting after dormancy. We used light microscopy (LM) combined with image analysis (IA) to determine the cellular localization and amount of starch in different cell types of stem and root tissues. Chemical analysis confirmed that starch concentrations were lower in plants receiving a high-N supply rate than in plants receiving a low-N supply rate. In all plants, the highest concentration of starch was in the roots. Light microscopy and IA showed that starch accumulated mainly in the phloem and cortical cells of both root and stem tissues. Starch grains were also regularly found in ray parenchyma cells. The amount of starch as well as the size of the grains showed strong seasonal fluctuations. In both roots and stems, starch concentrations were highest during predormancy and lowest during periods of shoot extension growth. At the time of resprouting, root cells of decapitated plants were more depleted of starch than root cells of intact plants, supporting the hypothesis that starch reserves in roots are important during the early phase of resprouting in coppice systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Possible tradeoffs between efficiency of water transport and mechanical strength were examined in stems of two congeneric pairs of co-occurring chaparral shrubs. First, since previously published results indicated that Adenostoma sparsifolium (Rosaceae) had greater specific conductivity (k(s) or hydraulic conductivity per xylem transverse area) than A. fasciculatum, it was hypothesized that A. sparsifolium would have greater vessel lumen area per square millimeter of xylem area, and less mechanical strength, than A. fasciculatum. Secondly, since Ceanothus megacarpus (Rhamnaceae) is a non-sprouter (unable to sprout from the root crown following fire or other major disturbance) whereas C. spinosus is a sprouter and thus able to form new stems following disturbance, it was hypothesized that C. megacarpus would have greater mechanical strength, but lower k(s), than C. spinosus. Both hypotheses were supported. Based upon computer-aided image analyses, A. sparsifolium had significantly higher mean and maximum vessel diameters (16.4, 40.5 vs. 14.6, 35.7 mu m), a 34% greater percent vessel lumen area, and a two-fold greater measured and theoretical k(s) than A. fasciculatum. This corresponded to 14% lower stem density (wet weight/volume) and less mechanical strength, with a 37% lower modulus of elasticity (MOE) and a 30% lower modulus of rupture (MOR) than A. fasciculatum. Similarly, C. spinosus had a significantly higher maximum vessel diameter (52.7 vs. 41.8 mu m) and a 92% higher theoretical k(s) (and 43% higher measured k(s)) than C. megacarpus. This corresponded to a 9% lower stem density and 20% lower MOR than for C. megacarpus. Thus, at least within these two congeneric pairs of chaparral shrubs growing together in the same habitat, there may be tradeoffs between mechanical strength and conductive efficiency of the stem xylem which correspond to differences in transport physiology and life history traits of sprouter versus non-sprouter species.},

  Abstract                 = {We examined the 7-year effects of three restoration treatments on leaf physiology and insect-resistance characteristics of pre-settlement age ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) at the Gus Pearson Natural Area (GPNA) in northern Arizona. Restoration treatments were: (1) thinned in 1993 to approximate pre-Euro-American settlement stand structure, (2) thinned plus prescribed burned in 1994 and 1998, and (3) untreated control. Tree physiological and insect-resistance characteristics were measured in year 2000, 7 years after thinning, using the same procedures as an earlier study performed in 1996. Consistent with the 1996 results, pre-dawn water potential in 2000 was consistently lower in the control than both thinned treatments. Both thinned treatments continued to have increased foliar nitrogen concentration in leaves 7 years after treatment. However lower leaf nitrogen concentration in the thinned and burned com- pared with the thinned treatment suggests lower nitrogen availability to trees in repeatedly burned plots. Analysis of leaf gas exchange characteristics and carbon isotope content (delta(13)C) suggests continued stimulation of photosynthesis by both thinning treatments. Differences among treatments in resin volume, a measure of bark beetle resistance, depended on season of measurement. Trees in both thinning treatments continued to have increased leaf toughness, a measure of resistance to insect folivores. Our results show that many beneficial effects of restoration treatments on carbon, water, and nitrogen relations and insect-resistance characteristics of pre-settlement ponderosa pines continue to be expressed 7 years after treatment at the GPNA.},

  Abstract                 = {We conducted a study linking mechanistic relationships among fire injury, tree physiological condition, and bark beetle (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) susceptibility. Crown scorch of 40 Pinus ponderosa trees was estimated in a naturally regenerated stand that was thinned and prescribed burned in winter and early spring 2000. Net photosynthetic rate (P-n) of undamaged foliage was higher in heavily and severely than moderately and lightly scorched trees. This trend was more pronounced in the dry season (June) than the wet season (August). This suggests the mechanism underlying the increase in P-n was an improvement in water relations. This was also supported by differences observed in predawn water potential and stomatal conductance (g(s)). Constitutive resin volume did not differ among crown scorch classes in June, but was negatively related to crown scorch intensity in September. This suggests that constitutive resin was formed and stored before fire injury, and therefore not strongly affected by crown scorch levels in June. Induced resin production (resin produced after depletion of constitutive resin) generally decreased with increasing crown scorch in both June and September. Induced resin appeared to be related to carbon available for resin synthesis. The proportion of successful colonization attempts by Ips spp. and Dendroctonus spp. was low throughout the season. Colonization of Ips sp. and Dendroctonus spp. was not spatially separated in host trees. Colonization attempts were generally positively related to intensity of crown scorch in both pheromone and no-pheromone treatments. This finding suggests that pheromones attracted insects to the tree, but host physiological condition or other factors ultimately determined host colonization. Our results also suggest that intensity of crown scorch may affect colonization attempts of Ips and Dendroctonus spp. on P. ponderosa trees.},

  Abstract                 = {We examined the role of population density in host selection behavior of an eruptive insect herbivore, the spruce beetle Dendroctonus rufipennis. We conducted field and laboratory experiments on spruce beetles from 29 endemic and eruptive populations in Alaska and Utah, USA, and Yukon, Canada. Beetles from both population phases colonized trees that had been felled to remove host defenses. However, only beetles from eruptive populations colonized defended, healthy trees. A series of laboratory assays using host-based media amended with varying concentrations of phytochemicals identified several factors affecting population-dependent responses to hosts. First, beetles were repelled by high concentrations of the predominant spruce monoterpene, alpha-pinene, but intermediate concentrations elicited entry and gallery construction. Second, heritability assays suggested high genetic variance of host selection behavior within populations, and between-population differences persisted following rearing in a common environment. Third, beetles from eruptive populations were less likely to enter medium amended with phytochemicals and constructed shorter galleries, which disagreed with our prediction and seemingly contradicted the field observations. However, fourth, beetle avoidance of high concentrations of alpha-pinene decreased with the addition of other beetles, and this effect was more pronounced among beetles from eruptive populations than among those from endemic populations. This interaction broadened the host range of eruptive beetles. We propose that such density-dependent behaviors can maintain heterogeneity among population phases and contribute to positive feedback in herbivore population dynamics. A conceptual model suggests how heritable and environmentally induced variation in host selection behavior can affect bimodal equilibria and numerical thresholds in eruptive species.},

  Abstract                 = {1. Bark beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) accept or reject host conifers based partly on concentrations of phloem monoterpenes. They colonise trees in aggregations, in response to pheromones that attract flying beetles to trees undergoing colonisation. A series of entry and gallery construction assays was conducted to determine whether responses by individual beetles to monoterpenes are altered by pheromones and/or the presence of other beetles. 2. Entry into the amended media by Ips pini and the length of time until entry were not influenced by the presence of aggregation pheromones. 3. Entry into amended media was influenced by the presence of other beetles on the surface of, or constructing galleries in, the substrate. The effects of alpha-pinene and limonene on host entry behaviour were mediated by the density of beetles on the surface of the assay arena, and by the density of beetles constructing galleries within the medium. 4. The percentage of beetles entering medium amended with higher concentrations of monoterpenes increased with increased density of beetles on the surface of the assay arena, until a threshold density of three or four beetles per assay arena, after which entrance rate declined. 5. The presence of other beetles constructing galleries elicited more rapid entry by the test beetles. 6. Gallery lengths were generally higher in the presence of aggregation pheromones. 7. Gallery lengths increased with increased density of beetles within the assay arena. 8. These results suggest a link between the density of bark beetles and responses of individuals. This linkage may partially explain behavioural changes observed during population eruptions.},

  Abstract                 = {The manner and extent to which physiological alterations resulting from folivory can affect the growth, survival, and resistance of trees against subsequent insects and fungi is poorly understood. Information obtained under natural conditions and with subcortically feeding insects is particularly lacking. We evaluated the effects of varying levels of natural feeding by a folivore on subsequent host growth, survival, and suitability to subcortical insects and fungi and also considered implications as to how source limitations caused by defoliation relate to current plant defense theories. The study system consisted of Choristoneura pinus pinus, the jack pine budworm, on Pinus banksiana Lamb., jack pine. We quantified a range of defoliation by C. pinus pinus in test trees and measured parameters of host defenses and colonization by bark beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) and woodborers (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae). We also measured colonization and accompanying tree mortality attributable to these insects. Tree physiological parameters and insect colonization patterns were measured over a 24-mo period. Primary resin flow rates and the ability of active responses to confine the bark beetle's fungal symbiont Ophiostoma ips within the phloem, were reduced by high levels of defoliation. These patterns were further influenced by host seasonal phenology and time since defoliation. The predominant subcortical insects responding to defoliation by C. pinus pinus were Ips grandicollis and Monochamus carolinensis. Colonization by these insects together increased exponentially in relation to defoliation level, but the two species differentially exploited trees from particular defoliation levels. The loss of growth among surviving trees increased with defoliation intensity. However, growth and defensive capacity were not related, either negatively or positively, during any interval of this study. Depending on the length of time since defoliation stress, the relationship between plant defense and defoliation intensity uas either parabolic, as predicted by growth differentiation theory, or inverse linear, as predicted by plant stress theory. Thus, differing models depicting how carbon allocation and overall carbon availability can influence secondary-chemical metabolism in plants may represent various stages along a temporal continuum. Our results suggest that the time since a stress is exerted is an important variant that should be incorporated into synthetic theories of plant defense. These results also suggest that integrative models of plant defense theory can be extended to describe impacts on community-level interactions.},

Data from paternal families of the bark beetle Ips pini (Say) were used to estimate the heritability of host acceptance and gallery construction behaviors. Males are the host-selecting gender in this genus. Male beetles were assayed over three generations to determine whether they rejected or accepted host media amended with concentrations of alpha-pinene that simulated host tissue, and 10% from each group were selected for breeding lines. In a separate experiment, 10% of individuals constructing the shortest and 10% of individuals constructing the longest galleries in this medium were established in separate breeding lines. The results indicate high additive genetic variation with respect to both traits. On the basis of the results with full-sib breeding lines, we estimated heritability of host acceptance behavior (i.e., entry into simulated hosts) at 0.78 and heritability of gallery construction behavior at 0.64. The divergence between lines in host acceptance and gallery construction behaviors was associated with paternal performance and was symmetrical. This study demonstrates that the use of phytochemical cues to accept potential hosts has a heritable component in bark beetles. L pini is a useful and convenient model for such studies.},

Forest tree density averaged more than 20 times the historical tree density, and basal area was 4 to 6 times higher in contemporary forests than in historical forests. Restoration treatments consisted of thinning young trees to emulate the forest density, tree composition, and spatial distribution in 1870, followed by prescribed burning. Following restoration treatment, tree density was significantly reduced but remained 6 times higher than historical forests. Basal area in restored forests was still 2.5 times greater than reconstructed basal area values. Ponderosa pine dominance changed little from pretreatment data across the four blocks, averaging 60% of stems and 87% of the basal area prior to treatment and 56% of stems and 85% of the basal area following treatment. Ninety-eight percent of contemporary forest trees were less than 100 yr old prior to restoration treatment;this proportion was reduced to 82% following treatment. Restoration treatment also significantly reduced canopy cover and increased total tree regeneration. However, treatment effects on forest fuels were highly variable. Litter and duff fuel layers were significantly reduced by prescribed fire but woody debris increased. Overall forest structural diversity following treatment implies that fire behavior, wildlife habitats, and other ecological attributes will vary relatively widely in the future landscape. FOR.

In this article, a two-species metapopulation model that includes local competitive dynamics is analyzed to study the population dynamics of two competing species in spatially structured habitats. When local stochastic extinction can be ignored, there are, as in Lotka-Volterra equations, four outcomes of interspecific competition in this model. The outcomes of competition depend on the competitive intensity between the competing pairs. An inferior competitor and a superior competitor, or two strongly competing species, can never stably coexist, whereas two weak competitors (even if they are very similar species) may coexist over the long term in such environments. Local stochastic extinction may greatly affect the outcomes of interspecific competition. Two competing species can or cannot stably coexist depending not only on the competitive intensity between the competing pairs but also on their precompetitive distributions. Two weak competitors that have similar precompetitive distributions can always regionally coexist. Two strongly competing species that competitively exclude each other in more stable habitats may be able to stably coexist in highly heterogenous environments if they have similar precompetitive distributions. There is also a chance for an inferior competitor to coexist regionally or even to exclude a superior competitor when the superior competitor has a narrow precompetitive distribution and the inferior competitor has a wide precompetitive distribution.},

  Abstract                 = {Rapid climate change may prompt species distribution shifts upward and poleward, but species movement in itself is not sufficient to establish climate causation. Other dynamics, such as disturbance history, may prompt species distribution shifts resembling those expected from rapid climate change. Links between species distributions, regional climate trends and physiological mechanism are needed to convincingly establish climate-induced species shifts. We examine a 38-year shift (1974–2012) in an elevation ecotone between two closely related ant species, Aphaenogaster picea and A. rudis. Even though A. picea and A. rudis are closely related with North American distributions that sometimes overlap, they also exhibit local- and regional-scale differences in temperature requirements so that A. rudis is more southerly and inhabits lower elevations whereas A. picea is more northerly and inhabits high elevations. We find considerable movement by the warm-habitat species upward in elevation between 1974 and 2012 with A. rudis, replacing the cold-habitat species, A. picea, along the southern edge of the Appalachian Mountain chain in north Georgia, USA. Concomitant with the distribution shifts, regional mean and maximum temperatures remain steady (1974–2012), but minimum temperatures increase. We collect individuals from the study sites and subject them to thermal tolerance testing in a controlled setting and find that maximum and minimum temperature acclimatization occurs along the elevation gradient in both species, but A. rudis consistently becomes physiologically incapacitated at minimum and maximum temperatures 2 C higher than A. picea. These results indicate that rising minimum temperatures allow A. rudis to move upward in elevation and displace A. picea. Given that Aphaenogaster ants are the dominant woodland seed dispersers in eastern deciduous forests, and that their thermal tolerances drive distinct differences in temperature-cued synchrony with early blooming plants, these climate responses not only impact ant-ant interactions, but might have wide implications for ant-plant interactions.},

Estimation of the slope in the case where the ratio of error variances is unknown could be considered as a maximum likelihood grouping method. The derivations are accompanied by some small sample simulations, and the tests are applied to data arising from work on seed allometry.},

Senescence is widely recognized to occur among plants with a single reproductive event, but the extent to which senescence occurs among plants with multiple reproductive events is open to debate. The latter may show gradual or even negligible senescence. The pattern of senescence cannot readily be ascribed to either morphology or phylogeny. While it has been widely argued that clonal growth allows plants to escape senescence, this is not necessarily the case.},

I describe two indices that use the number of nodes that separate taxa on a phylogeny as a measure of their phylogenetic relatedness. As an example of the use of these indices in community analysis, I compared the mean observed net relatedness of trees (greater than or equal to 10 cm diameter at breast height) in each of 28 plots (each 0.16 ha) in a Bornean rain forest with the net relatedness expected if species were drawn randomly from the species pool (of the 324 species in the 28 plots), using a supertree that I assembled from published sources. I found that the species in plots were more phylogenetically related than expected by chance, a result that was insensitive to various modifications to the basic methodology. I tentatively infer that variation in habitat among plots causes ecologically more similar species to co-occur within plots. Finally, I suggest a range of applications for phylogenetic relatedness measures in community analysis.},

We recognize a common pattern of phylogenetic conservatism in ecological character and highlight the challenges of using phylogenies of partial lineages. We also review phylogenetic approaches to three emergent properties of communities: species diversity, relative abundance distributions, and range sizes. Methodological advances in phylogenetic supertree construction, character reconstruction, null models for community assembly and character evolution, and metrics of community phylogenetic structure underlie the recent progress in these areas. We highlight the potential for community ecologists to benefit from phylogenetic knowledge and suggest several avenues for future research.},

Various hypotheses mechanistically link a species' community abundance with the diversity of the higher level taxon (genus, family, order) to which it belongs, but empirical data are equivocal about general trends in the relation between rank-taxon diversity and mean abundance. One reason for this inconclusive result may be the effect of the semisubjective nature of rank-based classification. We assessed the relationship between clade diversity and mean species abundance for two diverse tropical tree communities, using both traditional rank-based analysis and two new phylogenetic analyses (based on the ratio of individuals to taxa at each node in the phylogeny). Both rank-based and phylogenetic analyses using taxonomic ranks above the species level as terminal taxa detected a trend associating common species with species-rich families. In contrast, phylogenetic analyses using species as terminal taxa could not distinguish the observed distribution of species abundances from a random distribution with respect to clade diversity. The difference between these results might be due to (1) the absence of a real phylogeny-wide relationship between clade abundance and diversity, (2) the influence of poor phylogenetic resolution within families in our phylogenies, or (3) insufficient sensitivity of our metrics to subtle tree-wide effects. Further development and application of phylogeny-based methods for testing abundance-diversity relationships is needed.},

  Abstract                 = {The carbon flux from woody debris, a crucial uncertainty within global carbon-climate models, is simultaneously affected by climate, site environment and species-based variation in wood quality. In the first global analysis attempting to explicitly tease out the wood quality contribution to decomposition, we found support for our hypothesis that, under a common climate, interspecific differences in wood traits affect woody debris decomposition patterns. A meta-analysis of 36 studies from all forested continents revealed that nitrogen, phosphorus, and C : N ratio correlate with decomposition rates of angiosperms. In addition, gymnosperm wood consistently decomposes slower than angiosperm wood within common sites, a pattern that correlates with clear divergence in wood traits between the two groups. New empirical studies are needed to test whether this difference is due to a direct effect of wood trait variation on decomposer activity or an indirect effect of wood traits on decomposition microsite environment. The wood trait- decomposition results point to an important role for changes in the wood traits of dominant tree species as a driver of carbon cycling, with likely feedback to atmospheric CO2 particularly where angiosperm species replace gymnosperms regionally. Truly worldwide upscaling of our results will require further site- based multi-species wood trait and decomposition data, particularly from low-latitude ecosystems.},

Both of these consider the case where there is an independent and a dependent character and assign probabilities to various events in the dependent character given one or the other state of the independent character. The CCT gives different results for symmetric and asymmetric cladograms. In the latter case, the proportion of branches reconstructed as having the derived state has less influence on the resulting probabilities. The CST is only sensitive to the proportion of derived branches, regardless of whether the tree is symmetric or asymmetric. The CCT calculates probabilities by considering character state reconstructions which are not allowed by parsimony algorithms, thereby increasing the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis (type I error rate). We discuss some alternative questions that could be studied using these tests and also derive equations for calculating the number of possible events in the dependent character for unresolved parts of the phylogeny.},

  Abstract                 = {Anthropogenic climate change is likely to alter the patterns of moisture availability globally. The consequences of these changes on species distributions and ecosystem function are largely unknown, but possibly predictable based on key ecophysiological differences among currently coexisting species. In this study, we examined the environmental and biological controls on transpiration from a pinon-juniper (Pinus edulis Juniperus osteosperma) woodland in southern Utah, USA. The potential for climate-change-associated shifts in moisture inputs could play a critical role in influencing the relative vulnerabilities of pinons and junipers to drought and affecting management decisions regarding the persistence of this dominant landscape type in the Intermountain West. We aimed to assess the sensitivity of this woodland to seasonal variations in moisture and to mechanistically explain the hydraulic strategies of P. edulis and J. osteosperma through the use of a hydraulic transport model. Transpiration from the woodland was highly sensitive to variations in seasonal moisture inputs. There were two distinct seasonal pulses of transpiration: a reliable spring pulse supplied by winter- derived precipitation, and a highly variable summer pulse supplied by monsoonal precipitation. Transpiration of P. edulis and J. osteosperma was well predicted by a mechanistic hydraulic transport model (R-2 = 0.83 and 0.92, respectively). Our hydraulic model indicated that isohydric regulation of water potential in P. edulis minimized xylem cavitation during drought, which facilitated drought recovery (94\% of pre-drought water uptake) but came at the cost of cessation of gas exchange for potentially extended periods. In contrast, the anisohydric J. osteosperma was able to maintain gas exchange at lower water potentials than P. edulis but experienced greater cavitation over the drought and showed a lesser degree of post-drought recovery (55\% of pre-drought uptake). As a result, these species should be differentially affected by shifts in the frequency, duration, and intensity of drought. Our results highlight the sensitivity of this woodland type to potential climate-change-associated shifts in seasonal moisture patterns and demonstrate the utility of mechanistic hydraulic models in explaining differential responses of coexisting species to drought.},

  Abstract                 = {A leaf-height-seed (LHS) plant ecology strategy scheme is proposed. The axes would be specific leaf area SLA (light-capturing area deployed per dry mass allocated), height of the plant's canopy at maturity, and seed mass. All axes would be log-scaled. The strategy of a species would be described by its position in the volume formed by the three axes. The advantages of the LHS scheme can be understood by comparing it to Grime's CSR scheme, which has Competitors, Stress-tolerators and Ruderals at the corners of a triangle. The CSR triangle is widely cited as expressing important strategic variation between species. The C-S axis reflects variation in responsiveness to opportunities for rapid growth; in the LHS scheme, SLA reflects the same type of variation. The R axis reflects coping with disturbance; in the LHS scheme, height and seed mass reflect separate aspects of coping with disturbance. A plant ecology strategy scheme that permitted any species worldwide to be readily positioned within the scheme could bring substantial benefits for improved meta-analysis of experimental results, for placing detailed ecophysiology in context, and for coping with questions posed by global change. In the CSR triangle the axes are defined by reference to concepts, there is no simple protocol for positioning species beyond the reference datasets within the scheme, and consequently benefits of worldwide comparison have not materialized. LHS does permit any vascular land plant species to be positioned within the scheme, without time-consuming measurement of metabolic rates or of field performance relative to other species. The merits of the LHS scheme reside (it is argued) in this potential for worldwide comparison, more than in superior explanatory power within any particular vegetation region. The LHS scheme avoids also two other difficulties with the CSR scheme: (a) It does not prejudge that there are no viable strategies under high stress and high disturbance (the missing quadrant in the CSR triangle compared to a two-axis rectangle); (b) It separates out two distinct aspects of the response to disturbance, height at maturity expressing the amount of growth attempted between disturbances, and seed mass (inverse of seed output per unit reproductive effort) expressing the capacity to colonize growth opportunities at a distance. The advantage of LHS axes defined through a single readily-measured variable needs to be weighed against the disadvantage that single plant traits may not capture as much strategy variation as CSR's multi-trait axes. It is argued that the benefits of potential worldwide comparison do actually outweigh any decrease in the proportion of meaningful variation between species that is captured. Further, the LHS scheme opens the path to quantifying what proportion of variation in any other ecologically-relevant trait is correlated with the LHS axes. This quantification could help us to move forward from unprofitable debates of the past 30 years, where CSR opponents have emphasized patterns that were not accommodated within the scheme, while CSR proponents have emphasized patterns that the scheme did account for. }

  Abstract                 = {An important aim of plant ecology is to identify leading dimensions of ecological variation among species and to understand the basis for them. Dimensions that can readily be measured would be especially useful, because they might offer a path towards improved worldwide synthesis across the thousands of field experiments and ecophysiological studies that use just a few species each. Four dimensions are reviewed here. The leaf mass per area-leaf lifespan (LMA-LL) dimension expresses slow turnover of plant parts (at high LMA and long LL), long nutrient residence times, and slow response to favorable growth conditions. The seed mass-seed output (SM-SO) dimension is an important predictor of dispersal to establishment opportunities (seed output) and of establishment success in the face of hazards (seed mass). The LMA-LL and SM-SO dimensions are each underpinned by a single, comprehensible tradeoff, and their consequences are fairly well understood. The leaf size-twig size (LS-TS) spectrum has obvious consequences for the texture of canopies, but the costs and benefits of large versus small leaf and twig size are poorly understood. The height dimension has universally been seen as ecologically important and included in ecological strategy schemes. Nevertheless, height includes several tradeoffs and adaptive elements, which ideally should be treated separately. Each of these four dimensions varies at the scales of climate zones and of site types within landscapes. This variation can be interpreted as adaptation to the physical environment. Each dimension also varies widely among coexisting species. Most likely this within-site variation arises because the ecological opportunities for each species depend strongly on which other species are present, in other words, because the set of species at a site is a stable mixture of strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {Eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) has decreased in abundance over the past century throughout the Great Lakes Region of North America, but the relative constraints placed on recruitment under contrasting disturbance regimes are not well understood. The objectives of this study were to determine the extent to which white pine could invade areas recently disturbed by fire or logging (within 10-28 years), and assess the relative limitations placed on recruitment by seed supply, microsite habitat, and competition. We compared white pine regeneration on 61 sites disturbed by fire or logging that were adjacent to intact mature stands that provided a seed source. White pine seedling and sapling densities declined with increasing distance from a seed source, and the rate of decrease was determined by the interaction between seed supply and variation in number and quality of safe sites. For a given combination of seed source and site, white pine seedlings were three times more abundant on burned than logged sites. White pine seedlings grew into the sapling size class more often on burned than logged sites due to lower shrub cover on burned sites. At 25 years after disturbance, regeneration densities of white pine sufficient to achieve eventual future dominance occurred up to 80 m and 20 m from the edge of mature white pine stands after fire and logging, respectively. To attain a similar level of white pine stocking after disturbance, three to four times as many patches of mature white pine need to be left after logging than after fire.},

  Abstract                 = {Long-term canopy storage of seeds in fruits (bradyspory) varies among species and is thought to be related to the fire regime experienced by the plant community. This study sought to quantify intraspecific variation in bradyspory among nine populations of Banksia serrata (Proteaceae) on the south coast of New South Wales. Marked differences were found between populations, ranging from more than 30\% of follicles open at two coastal sites, to less than 5\% of follicles open at two inland heath sites. Low levels of bradyspory occurred particularly in coastal sites which also had Banksia integrifolia, a non-bradysporous species, present. In addition to spontaneous follicle opening without fire, fall of infructescences to the ground after breaking of branches was observed to be a major contributor to seed release. At three sites where fire had not occurred for many years, the amount of seedling establishment since the last fire corresponded well with levels of bradyspory; there were no inter-fire recruits at the site with the strongest bradyspory, while at the site with the weakest bradyspory there were numerous inter-fire plants, some with lignotubers large enough to be able to tolerate the next fire. It is argued that populations of B. serrata exhibit variable patterns of recruitment, depending on the site characteristics, ranging from complete dependence on fire for population maintenance to bet-hedging (spreading potential recruitment between fire events and inter-fire periods). Variations in populations and reproductive characteristics among sites make the application of demographic models to management decisions habitat-specific. }

  Abstract                 = {Pinus ponderosa Laws. (ponderosa pine) forests have changed considerably during the past century, partly because recurrent fires have been absent for a century or more. A number of studies have explored the influence of timber harvest or burning on understory production in ponderosa pine forests, but study designs incorporating cutting and prescribed burning in an experimental framework are needed to identify mechanisms responsible for the observed changes. In this study, we first characterized the disturbance history and the soil seed bank of a ponderosa pine stand in the northern Black Hills. We then experimentally addressed the effects of prescribed burning and overstory reduction on understory vegetation. Before Anglo settlement of the area, the mean fire interval was 14 years and no fires were recorded after 1879. Cessation of fires, prolific regeneration of ponderosa pine, and subsequent logging in 1903 has led to a very dense, even-aged ponderosa pine stand with very little understory vegetation and very few viable seeds in the soil seed bank. Only 57 individual plants, or 186 seeds/m(2), emerged from 1080 soil samples. Response of understory vegetation during the first growing season after application of treatments was sparse, with no significant treatment effect. There were, however, significant treatment effects during the second growing season. Total understory biomass ranged from 5.8 kg/ha on untreated plots to 1724 kg/ha on clearcut, unburned plots. Herbaceous dicots comprised over 90% of total understory biomass. Both understory species richness and evenness responded to treatments, but understory woody plant density did not respond to either treatment. Paucity of viable seeds in the soil seed bank does not appear to constrain recruitment of understory vegetation in dense ponderosa pine forests of South Dakota. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

New thermochemistry and flame-spread experiments using natural fuels contradict these results and indicate that sustained burning of forest fuels at moisture contents common to living plants does not occur between 21 \% and 35 \% O-2. Therefore, the fires under atmospheres with high oxygen concentrations would not have prevented the persistence of plant communities. Times of high O-2 also agree with observations of concurrent fire-resistant plant morphology, large insects, and high concentrations of fossil charcoal.},

  Abstract                 = {Mediterranean-type ecosystems experience prolonged summer drought. By the time of the first summer after a wildfire the root systems of seedlings are generally not developed enough to tap deep moisture resources, so seedlings often surpass their limits of tolerance to water stress, and mortality is high. Selective pressures therefore are possibly greater during the first summer drought after wildfire than at any other stage. Seedlings of Adenostoma fasciculatum Hook. & Arn. (chamise), one of the most common types of chaparral shrubs in southern California, which established after a wildfire in November 1993, had water potentials as low as -10 MPa at the end of summer 1994. Such low water potentials in woody plants are known to cause air emboli formation in xylem vessels and tracheids, potentially blocking water transport. By contrast, water potentials of the resprouts of chamise did not fall below -4.5 MPa. A comparative study of chamise seedlings and resprouts was initiated to ascertain whether the degree of xylem embolism was correlated with observed differences in minimum water potential and differential mortality (seedlings 79%, resprouts < 1%) of these two life stages. A newly developed technique was used that allows measurement of individuals with low levels of hydraulic conductance. Embolism (calculated as percentage loss in hydraulic conductance due to air emboli) was measured on whole shoots of seedlings and similar-sized branchlets of resprouts collected-at a field site in the Santa Monica Mountains. Seedlings with extremely low water potentials (-9.8 +/- 1.7 MPa, s.e., n = 10) were highly embolised (EMBOLISM = 82.8 +/- 2.0%). Resprouts, with an average water, potential of -3.8 +/- 1.8 MPa, exhibited quite moderate levels of embolism (26.0 +/- 4.6%). These values suggest that xylem embolism may have contributed to the high seedling mortality rate. Seedlings known to have very low water potentials showed a significant decrease in levels of embolism (63.2 +/- 6.1%, s.e., n = 4) after a rainfall event of 31 mm. Investigations suggested that this was due to positive-stem pressures in seedlings during or soon after the rainfall event causing refilling. The timing of post-fire rainfall events may be a critical factor in the survival and establishment of chamise seedlings.},

  Abstract                 = {Modern ecology often emphasizes the distinction between traditional theories of stable, environmentally structured communities and a new paradigm of disturbance-driven, nonequilibrium dynamics. However, multiple hypotheses for observed vegetation patterns have seldom been explicitly tested. We used multivariate statistics and variation partitioning methods to assess the relative influences of environmental factors and disturbance history on riparian and hillslope Forests. Our study area was the Cummins Creek Wilderness, located in the Oregon Coast Range. Most of the wilderness burned at least once between the mid-19th and early 20th centuries, creating a mosaic of younger forests with a few old-growth parches. Species composition on hillslopes varied primarily along a climatic gradient from moist maritime environments to drier inland climates but was relatively insensitive to forest age structure. The abundance of Tsuga heterophylla. a fire-sensitive, late-successional tree species, decreased with distance from old-growth patches, suggesting possible seed-source limitations following the historical fires. In contrast to species composition, hillslope forest structure was primarily related to fire history but was largely independent of environmental gradients. Old-growth structure characteristics such as large dominant trees, large snags, high down-wood volumes. and high tree size diversity increased with stand age and with the presence of remnant trees that survived the fires. Riparian forests had high shrub cover, abundant hardwoods, and high down-wood volumes, while the conifer-dominated hillslopes had high overstory density and basal area. Maritime climates and their associated plant species extended further inland in riparian areas than on hillslopes. Advance regeneration densities were higher in riparian forests within 5 km of the coast than in any other portion of the study area. Riparian forest structure and composition were related to both environmental and disturbance variables, with stream gradient and size integrating much of the fine-scale variability in disturbance regimes. No single theoretical framework was sufficient to explain the vegetation patterns observed in these forested watersheds. Our findings suggest a conceptual model of forest landscapes in which the relative influences of environment and disturbance on vegetation patterns are contingent on the facet of vegetation considered (composition vs, structure) and the portion of the landscape examined (hillslope vs. riparian).},

The stands of the ''lichen'' site type (LT) were stratified into three chronosequences according to stand density and fire history. Allometric equations were established from 90 sample trees for stem, coarse branch, fine branch, twig and needle biomass. The LT stands exhibited a low but sustained biomass accumulation until a stand age of 383 years. AGE reached only 6-10 kg(dw) m(-2) after 200 years depending on stand density and fire history compared to 20 kg(dw) m(-2) in the ''Vaccinium'' type (VT) stands. Leaf area index (LAI) in the LT stands remained at 0.5-1.5 and crown cover was 30-60%, whereas LAI reached 2.5 and crown cover was > 100% in the VT stands. Although nearest-neighbour analyses suggested the existence of density-dependent mortality, fire impact turned out to have a much stronger effect on density dynamics. Fire scar dating and calculation of mean and initial fire return intervals revealed that within the LT stands differences in structure and biomass were related to the severity of fire regimes, which in turn was related to the degree of landscape fragmentation by wetlands. Self-thinning analysis was used to define the local carrying capacity for biomass. A series of undisturbed LT stands was used to characterise the upper self-thinning boundary. Stands that had experienced a moderate fire regime were positioned well below the self-thinning boundary in a distinct fire-thinning band of reduced major axis regression slope -0.26. We discuss how this downward shift resulted from alternating phases of density reduction by fire and subsequent regrowth. We conclude that biomass in Siberian Scots pine forests is strongly influenced by fire and that climate change will affect ecosystem functions predominantly via changes in fire regimes.},

  Abstract                 = {The non-native invasive plant Chromolaena odorata (Asteraceae) was studied at 6 sites, with a chronosequence of ages from <1 to greater than or equal to 15 years, at St Lucia, South Africa. C. odorata density, biomass, seed production and soil seed banks were quantified in three microsites: sun, semi-shade and shade. C. odorata density decreased with invasion age, apparently as a self-thinning process. Biomass per unit area and seed production/plant increased over the first 10 years, but declined greatly at greater than or equal to 15 years. C. odorata plants grew larger and had much greater seed production in the sun relative to semi-shade, with small plants producing few if any seeds in the shade. Seed production in the sun varied from 2000 (<1-year old site) to 260 000 (10 year) seeds m(-2) annum(-1). About 20-46% of seeds produced were germinable and showed the same trend with age of invasion, but was particularly low after greater than or equal to 15 years. Assessment of soil seed banks immediately prior to seed production (seed greater than or equal to 10 months old), indicates that about 5-10% of seeds in the sun and 11-22% in the shade were still germinable, resulting in germinable seed densities of 12-385 and 158-511 m(-2), respectively (excluding the greater than or equal to 15-year old site). A greenhouse trial showed that burial of seeds, relative to those at the surface, and provision of less water, significantly improved seed persistence in the soil, while light intensity had no effect. Control of C. odorata is difficult due to rapid attainment of reproductive maturity, large production of wind-dispersed seeds and a short-term persistent seed bank. An integrated control strategy either excluding fire (coastal forest sites) or using fire prior to seed release in July/August to kill plants and soil-stored seeds immediately prior to seed production, together with biological, chemical and/or physical control, should be explored.},

  Abstract                 = {A cost-benefit approach was developed to analyze the carbon budget of the lowest Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) branches subject to abscission. In addition to within-branch growth and respiratory costs, the budget included an estimation of a branch's share of the maintenance respiration of the stem and root. A branch was considered productive if the budget was positive. Foliar gas exchange and woody-tissue respiration were nondestructively measured at monthly intervals during the growing season on the six lowest branches of 10-year-old Scots pine trees, to the moment when the branches died naturally. Photosynthetic light response and temperature response of respiration, together with measurements of canopy light conditions and meteorological data, were used to calculate seasonal carbon budgets for the branches. Maintenance respiration of stems and roots was estimated from published data. All but one of the branches studied were found to be nonproductive over the growing season. Following a decrease in photosynthetic capacity in July, the cumulative budget became negative and the branches died, indicating that a negative carbon budget corresponds with the onset of abscission of the lowest branches.},

  Abstract                 = {A theory for evolution of either gene sequences or molecular sequences must take into account that a population consists of a finite number of individuals with related sequences. Such a population will not behave in the deterministic way expected for an infinite population, nor will it behave as in adaptive walk models, where the whole of the population is represented by a single sequence. Here we study a model for evolution of population in a fitness landscape with a single fitness peak. This landscape is simple enough for finite size population effects to be studied in detail. Each of the N individuals in the population is represented by a sequence of L genes which may either be advantageous or disadvantageous. The fitness of an individual with k disadvantageous genes is W(K) = (1 - s)(k), where s determines the strength of, selection. In the limit L --> infinity, the model reduces to the problem of Muller's Ratchet: the population moves away from the fitness peak at a constant rate due to the accumulation of disadvantageous mutations. For finite length sequences, a population placed initially at the fitness peak will evolve away from the peak until a balance is reached between mutation and selection. From then on the population will wander through a spherical shell in sequence space at a constant mean Hamming distance [(k) over bar] from the optimum sequence. We give an approximate theory for the way [(k) over bar] depends on N, L, s, and the mutation rate u. This is found to agree well with numerical simulation. Selection is less effective on small populations, so [(k) over bar] increases as N decreases. Our simulations also show that the mean overlap between gene sequences separated by a time of t generations is of the form Q(t) = Q(infinity) + (Q(0) - Q(infinity))exp(-2ut), which means that the rate of evolution within the spherical shell is independent of the selection strength. We give a simplified model which can be solved exactly for which Q(t) has precisely this form. We then consider the limit L --> infinity keeping U = uL constant. We suppose that each mutation may be favourable with probability p, or unfavourable with probability 1 - p. We show that for p less than a critical value p(c), the population decreases in fitness for all values of U, whereas for p(c) < p < 1/2, the population increases in fitness for small U and decreases in fitness for large U. In this case there is an optimum non-zero value of U at which the fitness increases most rapidly, and natural selection will favour species with non-zero mutation rates.

The spectrum runs from quick to slow return on investments of nutrients and dry mass in leaves, and operates largely independently of growth form, plant functional type or biome. Categories along the spectrum would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale better than plant functional types, because functional types overlap substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some striking and significant patterns can be seen. Reliable quantification of the leaf economics spectrum and its interaction with climate will prove valuable for modelling nutrient fluxes and vegetation boundaries under changing land-use and climate.},

Both are tall, arborescent shrubs forming the overstory of the fynbos communities in which they occur. Seeds of L. conocarpodendron are dispersed by ants while those of P. lepidocarpodendron are dispersed by wind. The seedlings compete for space made available for periodic fires. Seedlings of the ant-dispersed species are scarce under the skeletons of the wind-dispersed species after a fire but relatively common in open sites. In contrast, seedlings of the wind-dispersed species are densest under their own skeletons and rare in open sites. Seedlings of the ant-dispersed species are outgrown by their wind-dispersed competitors and suffer reduced fecundity and increased mortality when they co-occur. The adult survival of the ant-dispersed species in light fires is also reduced when it establishes under or next to the wind-dispersed species. A Markovian model of the system suggests that ant dispersal of Leucospermum seed reduces the rate of competitive exclusion by Protea but is not sufficient to explain the persistence of the former in this system. To persist, Leucospermum requires open space, which is made available either by adult survival in light fires which set back its Protea competitor or by survival as seed banks through burns that destroy the seed banks of Protea.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we review those aspects that are relevant to the development of a mechanistic ecological theory to account for the structure and dynamics of Mediterranean forests, focusing our attention on mixed forests of helm oak (Quercus ilex L.), a shade-tolerant, slow-growing species that resprouts vigorously after disturbance, and Aleppo pine (Pinus halepen sis M.), a fast-growing, nonresprouting, shade-intolerant species. The main objectives of this report are: to introduce some of the primary features of these forests, showing their structural complexity and historical peculiarities; to show that much of this complexity can be conceptually reduced to two main factors of variation, soil-moisture gradients and a complex interaction of historical management and disturbance regimes; and to contrast the unique features of Mediterranean systems with other communities that have inspired generalization in ecology. Plants in Mediterranean-climate regions must face several environmental constraints during their life cycle: water limitation, competition for light, and a complex set of disturbance regimes, mainly fire, herbivory, and human exploitation. The response of co-occurring species to a given set of environmental constraints depends on a combination of physiological and morphological traits. In helm oak-Aleppo pine forests, the lower limit of distribution along a soil-moisture gradient appears to be controlled by dry-season water stress on seedling performance, and the upper limit seems to be controlled by shade tolerance relative to competitors. The processes that generate and maintain these patterns are related to the responses of the two species to the water and light environments that result from interacting gradients of disturbance and resource availability. The dynamics of mixed helm oak-Aleppo pine forests may be represented along two major environmental axes: water availability and light intensity; namely, time since last disturbance. At the regional scale, the presence of holm oak and Aleppo pine is expected to be driven mainly by the precipitation regime, with the proportion of Aleppo pine increasing toward the driest border and with helm oak being the dominant species in areas with higher precipitation. Changes of dominance of helm oak and Aleppo pine also respond to water availability at the local scale. In this case, variations between species depend on different factors in a complex way, because reduced soil-moisture levels may result either from low precipitation or from topography and edaphic features. The dynamics of helm oak-Aleppo pine forests are also determined by temporal changes in canopy closure; that is, forest recovery after disturbance. In this case, the proportion of Aleppo pine would increase in recently disturbed stands (i.e., with high light intensity reaching the forest floor), whereas regeneration of helm oak would be dominant under partially closed canopies. Theories of forest dynamics developed in humid regions may apply only poorly to Mediterranean plant communities, where vegetation change is qualitatively or quantitatively different. Thus, succession in temperate forests appears to be driven by differences in light availability and shade tolerance; but in Mediterranean plant communities, water limitation is of greater importance for the distribution of forest species. In Mediterranean landscapes the interaction of life-history strategies with changing environments is difficult to infer from observational and experimental studies. A mechanistic approach, in which competition or plant performance is measured as a function of resource availability, seems more feasible. The idea should be to develop multispecies models calibrated specifically for Mediterranean forests in a combined program of modeling, field research, and experimentation.},

In some eastern forests of North America, 30% of herbaceous species have ant-dispersed seeds. We conducted experiments to determine if fire ants are attracted to seeds of these plant species and assessed the amount of scarification or damage that results from handling by fire ants. Fire ants removed nearly 100% of seeds of the ant-dispersed plants \emph{Trillium undulation}, \emph{T. discolor}, \emph{T. catesbaei}, \emph{Viola rotundifolia}, and \emph{Sanguinaria canadensis}. In recovered seeds fed to ant colonies, fire ants scarified 80% of \emph{S. canadensis} seeds and destroyed 86% of {V. rotundifolia} seeds. Our study is the first to document that red imported fire ants are attracted to and remove seeds of species adapted for ant dispersal. Moreover, fire ants might damage these seeds and discard them in sites unfavorable for germination and seedling establishment. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Stem xylem cavitation was determined as percent loss of hydraulic conductivity. Stem freezing injury was measured as electrolyte leakage (EL). Root freezing injury was determined by EL and by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) reduction. Thaw duration was significantly correlated with dieback, new shoot growth, stem xylem cavitation, stem and root freezing damage, and root pressure (P < 0.05). In particular, shoot dieback was positively correlated with stem xylem cavitation (P < 0.001), residual stem xylem cavitation (P < 0.01) and root freezing injury (P < 0.010), but only weakly correlated with stem freezing damage (P < 0.05). In roots, freezing damage was negatively correlated with root pressure (P < 0.05), which, in turn, was negatively correlated with residual stem xylem cavitation after root pressure development. In stems, there was no correlation between freezing damage and xylem cavitation. We conclude that long periods of winter thaw followed by freezing resulted in freezing injury to roots concomitant with a reduction in root pressures, leading to poor recovery from freezing-induced xylem embolism.},
