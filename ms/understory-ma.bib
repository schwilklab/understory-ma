                  hardwood forests of the eastern United States over the past
                  14,000 years. Periodic fires were common in much of this area
                  prior to European settlement, and fire-resilient species
                  proliferated. Early European settlers commonly adopted Native
                  American techniques of applying fire to the landscape. As the
                  demand for wood products increased, large cutover areas were
                  burned, sometimes leading to catastrophic fires and
                  subsequent early successional habitats. By the early 1900s,
                  these catastrophic fires resulted in political pressure
                  leading to policies that severely restricted the use of fire.
                  Fire suppression continued through the twentieth century due
                  to an emphasis on commodity production and under-appreciation
                  of the ecological role of fire. Without fire, fire-sensitive
                  species were able to successfully outcompete fire-adapted
                  species such as oak and pine while early successional
                  habitats matured into older and more homogeneous forests. In
                  the late twentieth century, land managers began reintroducing
                  fire for ecosystem restoration, wildlife habitat improvement,
                  hazardous fuel reduction, and forest regeneration.
                  Responsible expanded use of ­prescribed fire and other
                  management tools in the region could help mitigate past
                  actions by increasing the amount and distribution of early
                  successional habitats, plant and animal diversity, and
                  landscape heterogeneity.},

                  (Pinus-Quercus) stands under changing human land uses on a
                  temperate forest landscape in eastern North America?
                  Location: Mill Mountain in the central Appalachian Mountains,
                  Virginia, US. Methods: A dendroecological reconstruction of
                  fire history was generated for four stands dominated by
                  xerophytic pine and oak species. The fire chronology began
                  under presettlement conditions following aboriginal
                  depopulation. Subsequent land uses included European
                  settlement, iron mining, logging, and US Forest Service
                  acquisition and fire protection. Results: Fires occurred
                  approximately every 5 years until 1930 without any evidence
                  of a temporal trend in fire frequency. Burning ceased after
                  1930. Area-wide fires affecting multiple pine stands were
                  common, occurring at intervals of approximately 16 years.
                  Most living pines became established during the late 1800s
                  and early 1900s. Dead pines indicated that an older cohort
                  established ca. 1730. Most hardwoods were established between
                  the 1920s and 1940s. Conclusions: Except for fire protection,
                  changes in land use had no discernible influence on fire
                  frequency. Lightning ignitions and/or large fire extent may
                  have been important for maintaining frequent burning in the
                  1700s, while fuel recovery may have constrained fire
                  frequency during later periods. The disturbance regime
                  appears to be characterized by frequent surface fires and
                  occasional severe fires, insect outbreaks or other
                  disturbances followed by pine recruitment episodes.
                  Industrial disturbances appear to have had little influence
                  on the pine stands. The greatest impact of industrial society
                  is fire exclusion, which permitted hardwood establishment.},

  abstract  = {Successful fire exclusion in the 20th century has created
                  severe fire problems across the West. Not every forest is at
                  risk of uncharacteristically severe wildfire, but drier
                  forests are in need of active management to mitigate fire
                  hazard. We summarize a set of simple principles important to
                  address in fuel reduction treatments: reduction of surface
                  fuels, increasing the height to live crown, decreasing crown
                  density, and retaining large trees of fire-resistant species.
                  Thinning and prescribed fire can be useful tools to achieve
                  these objectives. Low thinning will be more effective than
                  crown or selection thinning, and management of surface fuels
                  will increase the likelihood that the stand will survive a
                  wildfire. Five empirical examples of such treatment are
                  discussed: Hayfork fires, California, 1987; Tyee fire,
                  Washington, 1994; Megram fire, California, 1999; Hayman fire,
                  Colorado, 2002; and the Cone fire, California, 2002. Applying
                  treatments at an appropriate landscape scale will be critical
                  to the success of fuel reduction treatments in reducing
                  wildfire losses in Western forests. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

                  competition, community organization, and evolutionary ecology
                  of plants in a fire environment are examined. The last two
                  chapters focus on changing patterns of fire in modern

                  structures, assessing the influence of factors that caused
                  ecological change and evaluating remote sites as relatively
                  natural areas. Location Grand Canyon National Park contains
                  the largest never-harvested and long-term ungrazed forest
                  ecosystem in Arizona, providing valuable sites for measuring
                  natural variability. However, anthropogenic disruption of
                  natural fire regimes since Euro-American settlement c. 1880
                  has led to changes in forest structure. Methods We compared
                  species composition, tree structure, regeneration, and canopy
                  cover on large (135-603 ha) ponderosa pine-dominated study
                  sites: (1) isolated points on the North Rim where some
                  surface fires continued after 1880, (2) a higher-elevation
                  North Rim site where fire has been excluded and (3) a South
                  Rim site, also without recent fire, with a paired Kaibab
                  National Forest site. Forest tree structure prior to
                  fire-regime disruption was reconstructed with
                  dendroecological techniques. Results Before fire exclusion,
                  all sites had relatively low tree density (140-246 trees
                  ha(-1)) dominated by large trees (basal area 9.1-28.5 m(2)
                  ha(-1)), primarily ponderosa pine or pine/Gambel oak on the
                  South Rim. Currently all sites are relatively dense (389955
                  trees ha(-1), 14.1-41.3 m(2) ha(-1)) but patterns of species
                  composition and regeneration differed substantially with fire
                  regime and elevation. Regeneration at continued-fire sites
                  was primarily through sprouting species, Gambel oak and New
                  Mexican locust, forming a shrubby midstorey under a
                  relatively open pine canopy. In contrast, all fire-excluded
                  sites were dense with seed-reproducing conifer species. Main
                  conclusions Comparison of change caused by climate
                  fluctuation, tree cutting, fire exclusion, livestock
                  herbivory, and wildlife herbivory, suggests that fire regime
                  alteration appears to have played the greatest role. The
                  remote North Rim sites provide a close analogue to conditions
                  prior to fire regime disruption, a contemporary example of
                  the forest characteristics that might have been extant had
                  recent human-caused disruption of disturbance regimes and
                  heavy resource extraction not occurred. They merit broader
                  study of natural variability on a range of ecological
                  variables in ponderosa pine ecosystems.},

  abstract  = {Fire management practices affect alien plant invasions in
                  diverse ways. I considered the impact of six fire management
                  practices on alien invasions: fire suppression, forest fuel
                  reduction, prescription burning in crown-fire ecosystems,
                  fuel breaks, targeting of noxious aliens, and postfire
                  rehabilitation. Most western United States forests have had
                  fire successfully excluded for unnaturally long periods of
                  time, and this appears to have favored the exclusion of alien
                  plant species. Forest fuel reduction programs have the
                  potential for greatly enhancing forest vulnerability to alien
                  invasions. In part this is due to the focus on reestablishing
                  pre-Euro-American fire regimes on a landscape that differs
                  from pre-Euro-American landscapes in the abundance of
                  aggressive non-native species. We may be forced to choose
                  between restoring "natural" fire regimes or altering fire
                  regimes to favor communities of native species. Intensive
                  grazing in many western forests may exacerbate the alien
                  problem after fire and temporally decoupling grazing and fire
                  restoration may reduce the alien threat. Many shrubland
                  ecosystems such as the Intermountain West sagebrush steppe or
                  California chaparral have a natural, high-intensity crown
                  fire regime that is less amenable to forest restoration
                  tactics. Historical use of prescribed fire for type
                  conversion of shrublands to more useful grazing lands has
                  played some role in the massive annual grass invasion that
                  threatens these shrublands. Fuel breaks pose a special
                  invasive plant risk because they promote alien invasion along
                  corridors into wildland areas. Use of prescription burning to
                  eliminate noxious aliens has had questionable success,
                  particularly when applied to disturbance-dependent annuals,
                  and success is most likely when coupled with ecosystem
                  restoration that alters the competitive balance between
                  aliens and natives. Artificial seeding of alien species as a
                  form of postfire stabilization appears to cause more problems
                  than it solves and may even enhance alien invasion.},
