Abstract
========

We conducted a meta-analysis to determine the effects of fire and fire-surrogates on
understory vegetation in North America. Means and standard errors were extracted from papers containing data on the response of understory functional groups to thinning and burning treatments to calculate effect sizes. For each response variable, we compared three treatment pairs: burn versus control, thin vs control and thin vs burn. We calculated standardized mean differences (Hedges’ adjusted g, for each pair and tested if this differed from zero using a random effects model fit with restricted maximum likelihood). Most understory variables did not vary among treatments. Of the differences that were significant, they were the result of thinning and burning on native and non-native species. Richness of non-native plants was significantly higher in thin treatments than in control or burn treatments. In addition, cover of native plants was significantly higher in thin treatments than in control and burn treatments. Exotic plant cover was also significantly higher in thin treatments than in control treatments. In addition, shrubs cover was significantly lower after fire compared to the controls. We conclude that fire and fire-surrogates tend to have a slightly positive impact on native and non-native species richness and cover. These mixed results are likely due to variability in species-specific responses to the treatments.


Introduction
============

North American forests have been shaped by fire over evolutionary and ecological time scales. However, for much of the 20th century, land managers concentrated on minimizing the amount of land that burned. Compared to presettlement fire regimes in many contemporary forests, fire intervals have lengthened [@Cyr+Gauthier+etal-2009; @Spetich+Perry+etal-2011; @Aldrich+Lafon+etal-2010], although there is evidence for significant variability in historical fire return intervals [@Odion+Hanson+etal-2014]. Increased recognition of the central role of fire in maintaining forest structure and function has contributed to a shift from fire exclusion to the reintroduction of fire in fire-dependent forests, most often with the aim of reducing fuels and restoring historic stand structure [@Agee+Skinner-2005]. This recognition has prompted federal initiatives such as the National Fire Plan and Healthy Forest Restoration Act (2003) that mandate federal land managers to restore forest structure and function and reduce risk of wildfire on federal lands [Schoennagel+etal-2004; @Schoennagel+Nelson-2010].

Although prescribed fire is often the preferred fuel reduction practice, forest managers often face social and economic constraints on burning. Additionally, in forests thought to have departed significantly from historical fire return intervals, there is concern that introducing fire may result in unnaturally high intensity fire that may be difficult to manage or may have negative ecological effects. Therefore, mechanical fuel reduction methods have increasingly been used to reduce fuels or restore historic stand structure through thinning [@Crow+Perera-2004]. Uncertainty regarding the relative ecological effects of prescribed fire vs mechanical treatments has led to increasing attention to the ecological effects of fire and so-called "fire surrogates" such as the National Fire and Fire Surrogate study [@Schwilk+Keeley+etal-2009; @McIver+Stephens+etal-2012].

Early forest management emphasized recruiting trees for commercial harvest. However, in the last half of the 20th century, forest management practices have shifted focus to include managing for ecosystem services, including biodiversity. In most forests, the majority of plant biodiversity is found in the understory herbaceous layer.  In addition to harboring high diversity, understory herbaceous communities have profound effects on forest nutrient cycling [reviewed by  @Gilliam-2007]. Most attention has been paid to the effects of fire and mechanical treatments on forest structure and fuels and the extent to which mechanical treatments or thinning approximate effects of prescribed fire on forest understory vegetation is not as well understood. Results from the National Fire and Fire Surrogate study demonstrated that fire and mechanical treatments differed most in their effects on understory vegetation [@Schwilk+Keeley+etal-2009]. This is not entirely surprising, because although both fire and thinning remove overstory trees and allow increased light to reach understory plants, fire restructures habitat and soils that many plants depend on for germination and growth [@Bond+vanWilgen-1996; @Gundale+DeLuca+etal-2005; @DeLuca+MacKenzie+etal-2006; @Gundale+Metlen+etal-2006]. Thinning, on the other hand, removes vegetation from the forest instead of consuming vegetation and may alter nutrient dynamics [eg @Boerner+Waldrop+etal-2006]. Many mechanical thinning methods also result in soil disturbance and compaction that fire does not cause. The growing body of work comparing fire and thinning effects on vegetation offers an opportunity to increase the generality of conclusions through meta-analysis.


Objectives
----------

Our objective was to conduct a meta-analysis of the literature that investigated effects of thin and burn treatments on understory herbaceous and shrub species in dry forests in North America. Specifically, we were interested in the degree to which thin treatments mimic prescribed burn treatments and control or no treatment patches. Because species-specific literature is sparse for understory vegetation we restricted our analyses to functional groups. 

We ask the following questions:

1. Do thin treatments have similar percent cover of native species, exotic species, graminoids, forbs, and shrubs compared to prescribed burn and control treatments?
2. Do thin treatments have similar species richness of native species, exotic species, graminoids, forbs, and shrubs compared to prescribed burn and control treatments?

We hypothesize burn and thin treatments have higher percent cover and species richness of understory plants compared to controls. We also hypothesize that thin treatments will have increased cover and richness of non-native species native species compared to prescribed burn treatments.


Methods

Literature Search and Vetting
-----------------------------

In May 2014 we performed a search of the scientific literature investigating effects of prescribed fire and thinning treatments on understory vegetation. We used multiple databases: Web of Science [CITE] and AGRICOLA [CITE] both of which searched literature published since 1970 and Forest Science which searched literature published since 1939. We also used [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/) which, in addition to excellent coverage of recent journal articles, has good coverage of gray literature publications as well as proceedings which sometimes led to published articles. See search terms, Appendix 1 [DWS: TODO]. In addition to these three search engines, we included additional references gleaned from publications found in the literature search and from a recent U.S. Department of Agriculture / U.S. Department of Interior Joint Fire Sciences Rainbow Series document on the effects of fire on invasive plant species [@Zouhar+Smith+etal-2008]. The literature search from the databases yielded approximately 3,500 references which were then vetted for appropriate material. Documents were eliminated that dealt with medical issues (i.e. new treatments for burn victims), investigations of ecological processes related to fire but not relevant to the scope of this document (i.e. nutrient cycling, insect infestation, etc.), or modeling studies with little empirical data. Papers from geographical locations outside of North America were also excluded.

We were specifically interested in studies that were experimental in nature and that collected quantitative data on the response of understory herbaceous plants to a prescribed fire or thinning treatment. We further narrowed our search to papers that specifically compared thinning (understory or overstory) and prescribed fire. We excluded papers that dealt exclusively with thinning, prescribed fire or wildfire. This vetting process yielded the 35 references included in this document.

Because statistical reporting was not uniform across references, we performed a second round of vetting to exclude papers that could not be placed in a quantitative meta analysis. Papers that reported chi square tests, standardized mean differences, and failed to include standard errors were excluded [DWS: Josh, why, shouldn't those work for H^2?]. In addition, studies which reported data that was collected 20 or more years after the thinning or burning event were excluded. After the final vetting, a total of 22 references remained.

Data Extraction and Analysis
----------------------------

For each selected article, we recorded the location of the study, the forest type and age, treatment type, intensity of the treatment, sampling method, and response. We calculated pairwise treatment effect sizes for each response variable for three different pairwise comparisons: Thin vs Burn, Thin vs Control, and Burn vs Control. We conducted all analyses in R [@R_Development_Core_Team-2013] using the metafor package [@Viechtbauer-2010]. All hypotheses were a priori, thus no adjustments for multiple comparisons were made. Because we were making one-tail comparisons, we used $\alpha = 0.1$.

[DWS; then make sure your hypotheses are one-tailed and make sure CIs are alpha=0.1. Right now both are 2-tailed]

A handful of compromises and assumptions were necessary to reconcile each reference into a single, comparable format. When papers reported mean species richness or percent cover values and standard errors for multiple years per treatment, the mean of these means and standard errors was taken to generate a single representative value. This methodology was used when extracting data from @Metlen+Fiedler-2006, @Phillips+Waldrop-2008, @Laughlin+Fulé-2008, @Mason+Baker+etal-2009, and @Waldrop+Yaussy+etal-2008. All other sources reported data for a single year.

[DWS: Josh, Your references table in the repo does not have the full references. Please solve this and make sure the schwilk.bib file has all references we used.only Zald etal 2008 ref I could find was for overstory only ??. Could not find correct Fule ref, but he has others which should have data].
And a few bibs I want to make sure you checked:

- http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112705004573


Because native species represented over 99% of species richness and percent cover for papers in which both parameters were reported, 'total' and 'native' species were used interchangeably for papers in which only one or the other was reported [@Metlen+Fiedler-2006; @Nelson+Halpern+etal-2008; @Kerns+Thies+etal-2006]. 'Native' was used for 'total' in @Dodson+Metlen+etal-2007, @Collins+Moghaddas+etal-2007, and Huffman+Stoddard-2013. 'Total' was used for 'native' in @Youngblood+Metlen+etal-2006, @Wolk+Rocca-2009, @Phillips+Waldrop-2008, Fule+Covington+etal-2002, @Laughlin+Bakker+etal-2008, @Mason+Baker+etal-2009, @Zenner+Kabrick+etal-2006, @Waldrop+Yaussy+etal-2008, @Stoddard+McGlone+etal-2011, @Shive+Kenzi+etal-2013, and @Scudieri+Sieg+etal-2010.

[DWS: Josh, check references.  You had (Fule et al 2007) but table said 2002, see other notes, above]

Papers with a wide degree of sampling methodologies and time-lines were included. Length of time from treatment to sampling ranged from 1 to 13 years (mean = 4 years) [DWS: median=?]. Only two papers reported data that was collected more than 9 years after treatment. Varying levels of prescribed burn severity were inherent due to differences in species composition, terrain, weather, and season. For studies which reported data for multiple levels of burning severity, the moderate level of burning was selected for inclusion in this analysis. Varying forms of thinning and mastication were used in thinning treatments. These included, chainsaw, dragging a chain between tractors, hand-thinning, thin-and-pile, thin-and-burn, thin-and-scatter, thin-only, thin-and-chip, partial-cut, and clear-cut. For each paper, data were selected that were close to a thin-only treatment as possible.


Results
=======

[DWS: No need for predictions here, those are not results]


Species Richness
----------------

Thinning increased exotic species richness as compared to burns and controls. There was no significant difference in exotic species richness between burn and control treatments.

There was no significant difference in species richness for the total number of species, native species, forbs, graminoids, or shrubs between burn and control treatments, thin and control treatments, or thin and burn treatments.

Percent Cover
-------------

Thinning increased percent cover of native species and exotic species as compared to burning and the controls which did not differ.

Shrubs were the only functional group to experience a significant decrease in percent cover after any form of treatment. There was a significant decrease in shrub percent cover between burn and control treatments. There was no significant difference in shrub percent cover between thin and burn treatments, or between burn and control treatments. 



Table 1: Standardized mean differences. An "*" indicates a significant result at $\alpha = 0.1$. [DWS: is this true? Table need to be improved.  Perhaps separate tables for subsets of variables?]


There were not a sufficient number of papers that reported data on forb richness, forb cover, and graminoid richness for burn vs control, thin vs control, or thin vs control groups. Because of this, further study on the effects of burning and thinning on forb richness, forb cover, and graminoid richness are needed for analysis to take place.


Discussion
==========

In general, understory plant species did not respond as predicted to fire surrogate treatments. Disturbance treatments were different from controls as predicted but thinning and burning were not surrogates. Thinning increased understory cover and richness (both native and non-native) which presumably increased understory diversity and thus, forest diversity. In addition thinning has the negative consequence of enhancing richness and cover of non-native species which is not a desirable outcome in most management scenarios. Burning reduced shrub cover as compared to the other two treatments and this may or may not be a negative consequence depending on the management objective. 

In addition to the significant findings reported above, there were a handful of results that suggested a trend, and could be analyzed in the near future after additional data has been collected. Total species richness and native richness may increase after thinning. This would support our finding that both native cover and non-native richness increase after this disturbance treatment. Total species percent cover may also decrease in response to fire. Our analyses suggest burning does not increase exotic plants in the understory but this also requires further work.

Increase of exotic species due to disturbance is well established as is the intensity of disturbance and amount of increase [@Bartuszevige+Kennedy-2009; @Schwilk+Keeley+etal-2009]. One concern of manipulating systems for conservation outcomes (e.g. fire surrogate treatments) is the risk of increasing the amount of exotic species. This is especially true when large-scale manipulations are applied such as in national forests for which follow-up treatment may be unfeasible. Although increases in these studies were not large, they could be biologically significant if they were allowed to increase in forest understory or if they were introduced after the treatment application. However, some forest stands may be at greater risk for establishment of exotic species. For example, exotic species are less likely to establish in the interior of forests, and more likely to establish in areas near other large invasions and human establishments [CITATIONS, @Bartuszevige+Gorchov+etal-2006]. Thus, an important consideration for treatment application is proximity to the wildland urban interface (WUI).

To prevent the spread of exotic plants into forest ecosystems after thinning, managers should consider several management options including: no treatment, pre-treatment of exotic plants to reduce their abundance prior to treatment, seeding with native plants [@Korb+Johnson+etal-2004], reducing grazing by domestic livestock prior to and immediately after treatment [@Keeley-2006b], or conducting a low impact disturbance (e.g. burning only); [@Dodson+Fiedler-2006; @Laughlin+Bakker+etal-2008]. Thinning treatments in particular can be modified to reduce soil disturbance (which facilitates invasion of exotic plants). Also, thinning in winter months when equipment will drive over snow will also minimize soil disturbance and thus, the probability of invasion [@Gundale+DeLuca+etal-2005].

We had insufficient data on forbs to generate significant results. Further studies directed at the effects of fire and fire surrogates on forb richness and cover are needed for analysis to take place.


Many of the studies included in this review concluded that multiple entries into a forest are needed to properly restore the understory to the historical range of variation [Harrington+Edwards-1999; @Metlen+Fiedler-2006; @Laughlin+Bakker+etal-2008; @Waldrop+Yaussy+etal-2008]. Few studies have followed systems over multiple entries; however, Laughlin et al. [-@Laughlin+Bakker+etal-2008] followed a restoration for over a decade after multiple entries. In this system, there was an immediate positive response to herbaceous production. However, differences in species richness took much longer to occur; species richness was higher in treated areas compared to controls after 11 years. The results from this long-term study indicate that restoration of the understory to historical variability is a long-term process involving repeated prescribed burns. The @Laughlin+Bakker+etal-2008 data also provide another important lesson: active fire suppression has occurred for most of the last century and restoration management of the forests is a relatively new occurrence, therefore, it may take multiple treatments to restore a forest. In addition, it may take many years before the effects of the treatments are fully realized.

While it may take many years for the effects of restoration treatments to become fully realized, the results also depend on the pretreatment condition of the area [@Dodson+Peterson+etal-2008]. @Dodson+Peterson+etal-2008 found that treatments did affect understory plant response but the degree of the response was dependent on the pre-treatment condition of the forest such that greater responses were observed in treatment plots with lower initial values. One reason @Dodson+Peterson+etal-2008 were able to document this affect was the Before-After-Control-Impact design of the FFS study. Instead of only collecting data in an unmanipulated “control” plot, pretreatment data were also collected. This is a powerful experimental design that should be encouraged in future investigations of forest restoration.

@Dodson+Peterson-2010 investigated potential differences in treatment effect at multiple spatial scales. They found that treatment did not significantly affect species richness at the smaller quadrat scale (alpha diversity) but diversity at the unit scale (beta diversity) was significantly increased. Thus, effects of forest treatments may not be evident at the scale at which most monitoring is conducted (1 m$^2$) but overall impacts may be evident at the forest level. The studies included in this review typically measured results at smaller spatial scales (1--400 m$^2$) and evaluated alpha diversity. However, additional analysis to investigate beta diversity may reveal more consistent patterns and may shed light on large-scale impacts of fire and fire surrogate treatments on understory plant communities.

Finally human socio-economic factors are often considered when determining application of treatments. Exotic plants are also associated with the wildland urban interface (WUI) because many exotics are used in landscape and horticultural plantings. Although the Healthy Forest Restoration Act (2003) mandates that most of the forest restoration occurs at the WUI, it is important to recognize that these areas serve as foci for exotic spread into the forest matrix [@Bartuszevige+Gorchov+etal-2006]. Invasion of the forest by exotic plants works against the prescribed goals of forest management to reduce wildfire risk and increase native biodiversity. Some exotic plants can change the fire interval or intensity through a variety of mechanisms such as increasing fuel loads or moisture content of the fuel [@Brooks+DAntonio+etal-2004]. In addition, exotic plants can reduce biodiversity by becoming the dominant species in the forest understory.

Non-native plants were recorded in most studies we presented, but were often at a low density or cover, even post-treatment. Regardless, it is important to understand the potential threat of these species to native understory species in forested landscapes. In general, prescribed fire and thinning treatments can be used successfully to restore understory community composition, but managers would be wise to take into consideration the presence and potential impacts of exotic plants.
