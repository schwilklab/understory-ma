Abstract
========

We conducted a meta-analysis to determine the effects of fire and fire-surrogates on
understory vegetation in North America. Means and standard errors were extracted from papers containing data on the response of understory functional groups to thinning and burning treatments to calculate effect sizes. For each response variable, we compared three treatment pairs: burn versus control, thin vs control and thin vs burn. We calculated standardized mean differences (Hedges’ adjusted g, for each pair and tested if this differed from zero using a random effects model fit with restricted maximum likelihood. Most understory variables did not vary among treatments. Of the differences that were significant, they were the result of thinning and burning on native and non-native species. Richness of non-native plants was significantly higher in thin treatments than in control or burn treatments. In addition, cover of native plants was significantly higher in thin treatments than in control and burn treatments. Exotic plant cover was also significantly higher in thin treatments than in control treatments. In addition, shrubs cover was significantly lower after fire compared to the controls. We conclude that fire and fire-surrogates tend to have a slightly positive impact on native and non-native species richness and cover. These mixed results are likely due to variability in species-specific responses to the treatments. Because of insufficient data species-specific datawe were limited to functional group analyses. Future studies should investigate species-spec provide insight into specific species, meaning that studies directed towards these species are necessary.


Introduction
============

Most North American forest plant species evolved under the influence of fire. However, for much of the 20th century, land managers concentrated on minimizing the amount of land that burned. Compared to presettlement fire regimes in many contemporary forests, fire intervals have greatly lengthened [cite]. Increased recognition of the central role of fire in maintaining forest structure and function has contributed to a shift from fire exclusion to the reintroduction of fire in fire-dependent forests. This recognition has prompted federal initiatives such as the National Fire Plan and Healthy Forest Restoration Act (2003) that mandate federal land managers to restore forest structure and function and reduce risk of wildfire on federal lands (Graham et al., 2004; Schoennagel et al., 2004). It is now widely accepted that the return of fire to dry forests restores ecological processes, creates ecologically valuable early successional habitats, and is consistent with management objectives aimed at maintenance of biodiversity and decreased risk of landscape-scale wildfires (Brawn et al., 2001; Fulé et al., 2004). However, how and if the process of fire is reintroduced is less certain, particularly since fire-suppressed forests have developed dramatically different structures than when fire was more frequent (Covington and Moore 1994, Van Lear et al., 2005). Thus, fire managers may employ mechanical thinning techniques which yield a more predictable result.

The extent to which thinning approximates effects of prescribed fire in forested ecosystems on understory vegetation is not well understood. Fire is a unique ecosystem disturbance that restructures habitat and soils that many plants depend on for germination and growth (Boerner et al., 2006; Bond and van Wilgen, 1996; Lione, 2002; Whigham 2004; Gundale et al., 2005, 2006). Thinning is a disturbance that removes vegetation from the forest instead of consuming vegetation. Unless the slash is left on site, the nutrients stored in the vegetation are lost from the system. As a result, influxes of nutrients in thinned forests may be lower and different in composition than in burned forests. In a loblolly/short leaf pine forest, thinning increased potassium and magnesium, whereas fire decreased carbon and nitrogen in the organic horizon; both treatments increased soil pH (Lione, 2002). In a mixed oak forest, thinning reduced soil carbon in the first year post-treatment in contrast to burned areas in which a reduction in soil carbon was not detected for several years post-treatment (Boerner et al., 2006). However like burning, thinning increases bare mineral soil (Boerner et al., 2007). By thinning the canopy, light is increased at the forest floor, which can increase surface temperatures. The additional bare mineral soil and light can provide areas for seeds to germinate and establish as seedlings; however, this effect may only occur if slash is removed.

Early forest management emphasized recruiting trees for commercial harvest. However, in the last half of the 20th century, forest management practices have shifted focus to include managing for ecosystem services, including biodiversity. In most forests, the majority of plant biodiversity is found in the understory herbaceous layer (Gilliam 2007). In addition to harboring high diversity, understory herbaceous communities have profound effects on forest nutrient cycling (reviewed by Gilliam, 2007). Thus, thinning and fire may not have similar effects on understory vegetation. 


Objectives
----------

Our objective was to conduct a meta-analysis of the literature that investigated effects of thin and burn treatments on understory herbaceous and shrub species. Specifically we are interested in the degree to which thin treatments mimic prescribed burn treatments and control or no treatment patches. Because species-specific literature is sparse for understory vegetation we restricted our analyses to functional groups. 
We ask the following questions:

1. Do thin treatments have similar percent cover of native species, exotic species, graminoids, forbs, and shrubs compared to prescribed burn and control treatments?
2. Do thin treatments have similar species richness of native species, exotic species, graminoids, forbs, and shrubs compared to prescribed burn and control treatments?

We hypothesize thin and burn treatments have higher percent cover and species richness of native species, graminoids, forbs and shrubs compared to control and lower percent cover and species richness of exotic species compared to control. We also hypothesize that thin and burn treatments have the same percent cover and species richness of native species, graminoids, forbs and shrubs compared to prescribed burn treatments and lower percent cover and species richness compared to prescribed fire.

Methods

Literature Search and Vetting
-----------------------------

In December 2007, July 2008, and December 2011 we performed a search of the scientific literature investigating effects of prescribed fire and thinning treatments on understory vegetation. Table 1 provides a detailed list of the keywords used in the literature search. We used three databases: Web of Science and AGRICOLA both of which searched literature published since 1970 and Forest Science which searched literature published since 1939. In addition to those two search engines, we included additional references gleaned from publications found in the literature search and from a recent U.S. Department of Agriculture / U.S. Department of Interior Joint Fire Sciences Rainbow Series document on the effects of fire on invasive plant species (Zouhar et al., 2008). The literature search from the databases yielded approximately 3,000 references which were then vetted for appropriate material. Documents were eliminated that dealt with medical issues (i.e. new treatments for burn victims), investigations of ecological processes related to fire but not relevant to the scope of this document (i.e. nutrient cycling, insect infestation, etc.), or modeling studies with little empirical data.

We were specifically interested in studies that were experimental in nature and that collected quantitative data on the response of understory herbaceous plants to a prescribed fire or thinning treatment. We further narrowed our search to papers that specifically compared thinning (understory or overstory) and prescribed fire. We excluded papers that dealt exclusively with thinning, prescribed fire or wildfire. This vetting process yielded the 24 references included in this document.

In 2014 (January --- May) we performed a second search of the scientific literature to increase our sample size. Table 2 provides a detailed list of the keywords used in this literature search. We used the Google Scholar and Mendeley search engines to find papers published after the original search. The second literature search yielded approximately 250 references which were then vetted for appropriate material using the same criteria as used in the first search. This vetting process yielded an additional 11 references, for a total of 35 references.

[DWS: I don't think Table of search terms is needed.  Simply explain we used all combinations of burn, fire, thin, surrogate, rare, etc.].  IT is really jsut a list of terms.  Perhaps save full list for appendix


Because statistical reporting was not uniform across references, we performed a second round of vetting to exclude papers that could not be compared to the others statistically. Papers that reported chi square tests, standardized mean differences, and failed to include standard errors were excluded. In addition, studies which reported data that was collected 20 or more years after the thinning or burning event were excluded. Papers from geographical locations outside of North America were also excluded. After the final vetting, a total of 22 references remained.

Data Extraction and Analysis
----------------------------

For each selected article, we recorded the location of the study, the forest type and age, treatment type, intensity of the treatment, sampling method, and response. We calculated pairwise treatment effect sizes for each response variable for three different pairwise comparisons: Thin vs Burn, Thin vs Control, and Burn vs Control. We conducted all analyses in R (R Core Team 2013) using the metafor package (Viechtbauer 2010). All hypotheses were a priori, thus no adjustments for multiple comparisons were made. Because we were making one-tail comparisons, we used $\alpha = 0.1$.

A handful of compromises and assumptions were necessary to reconcile each reference into a single, comparable format. When papers reported mean species richness or percent cover values and standard errors for multiple years per treatment, the mean of these means and standard errors was taken to generate a single representative value. This methodology was utilized when extracting data from Metlen & Fiedler (2006), Phillips & Waldrop (2008), Laughlin et al. (2008), Mason et al. (2009), Waldrop et al. (2008), and Zald et al. (2008). All other sources reported data for a single year.

Because native species represented over 99% of species richness and percent cover for papers in which both parameters were reported, 'total' and 'native' species were used interchangeably for papers in which only one or the other was reported (Metlen & Fiedler 2006, Nelson et al. 2008, Kerns et al. 2006). 'Native' was used for 'total' in Dodson et al. (2007), Collins et al. (2007), and Huffman et al. (2013). 'Total' was used for 'native' in Youngblood et al. (2006), Wolk & Rocca (2009), Phillips & Waldrop (2008), Fule et al. (2007), Laughlin et al. (2008), Mason et al. (2009), Zenner et al. (2006), Waldrop et al. (2008), Stoddard et al. (2001), Shive et al. (2013), and Scudieri et al. (2010).

Papers with a wide degree of sampling methodologies and time-lines were included. Length of time from treatment to sampling ranged from 1 to 13 years (mean = 4 years). Only two papers reported data that was collected more than 9 years after treatment. Varying levels of prescribed burn severity were inherent due to differences in species composition, terrain, weather, and season. For studies which reported data for multiple levels of burning severity, the moderate level of burning was selected for inclusion in this analysis. Varying forms of mastication were utilized for thinning treatments. These included, chainsaw, dragging a chain between tractors, hand-thinning, thin-and-pile, thin-and-burn, thin-and-scatter, thin-only, thin-and-chip, partial-cut, and clear-cut. For each paper, data were selected that were close to a thin-only treatment as possible.


Results
=======

[DWS: No need for predictions here, those are not results]

We predicted thin and burn treatments would have outcomes different from control or no treatment groups. We also predicted thinning would be a surrogate for burning and thus, should not differ in the response of understory vegetation. In particular, treatments were assumed to increase species richness and percent cover of native species and decrease species richness and percent cover of exotic species. The results only partially supported our predictions. A summary of the significant findings can be found in Table 3. These are described in more detail below.

Species Richness
----------------

Thinning increased exotic species richness as compared to burns and controls. There was no significant difference in exotic species richness between burn and control treatments.

There was no significant difference in species richness for the total number of species, native species, forbs, graminoids, or shrubs between burn and control treatments, thin and control treatments, or thin and burn treatments.

Percent Cover
-------------

Thinning increased percent cover of native species and exotic species as compared to burning and the controls which did not differ.

Shrubs were the only functional group to experience a significant decrease in percent cover after any form of treatment. There was a significant decrease in shrub percent cover between burn and control treatments. There was no significant difference in shrub percent cover between thin and burn treatments, or between burn and control treatments. 



Table 1: Standardized mean differences. An "*" indicates a significant result at $\alpha = 0.1$. [DWS: is this true? Table need to be improved.  Perhaps separate tables for subsets of variables?]


There were not a sufficient number of papers that reported data on forb richness, forb cover, and graminoid richness for burn vs control, thin vs control, or thin vs control groups. Because of this, further study on the effects of burning and thinning on forb richness, forb cover, and graminoid richness are needed for analysis to take place.


Discussion
==========

In general, understory plant species did not respond as predicted to fire surrogate treatments. Disturbance treatments were different from controls as predicted but thinning and burning were not surrogates. Thinning increased understory cover and richness (both native and non-native) which presumably increased understory diversity and thus, forest diversity. In addition thinning has the negative consequence of enhancing richness and cover of non-native species which is not a desirable outcome in most management scenarios. Burning reduced shrub cover as compared to the other two treatments and this may or may not be a negative consequence depending on the management objective. 

In addition to the significant findings reported above, there were a handful of results that suggested a trend, and could be analyzed in the near future after additional data has been collected. Total species richness and native richness may increase after thinning. This would support our finding that both native cover and non-native richness increase after this disturbance treatment. Total species percent cover may also decrease in response to fire. Our analyses suggest burning does not increase exotic plants in the understory but this also requires further work.

Increase of exotic species due to disturbance is well established (CITATIONS) as is the intensity of disturbance and amount of increase (Bartuszevige and Kennedy 2009, Schwilk et al. 2009, OTHER CITATIONS). One concern of manipulating systems for conservation outcomes (e.g. fire surrogate treatments) is the risk of increasing the amount of exotic species. This is especially true when large-scale manipulations are applied such as in national forests for which follow-up treatment may be unfeasible. Although increases in these studies were not large, they could be biologically significant if they were allowed to increase in forest understory or if they were introduced after the treatment application. However, some forest stands may be at greater risk for establishment of exotic species. For example, exotic species are less likely to establish in the interior of forests, and more likely to establish in areas near other large invasions and human establishments (CITATIONS, Bartuszevige et al. 2006). Thus, an important consideration for treatment application is proximity to the wildland urban interface (WUI).

To prevent the spread of exotic plants into forest ecosystems after thinning, managers should consider several management options including: no treatment, pre-treatment of exotic plants to reduce their abundance prior to treatment, seeding with native plants (Korb et al., 2004), reducing grazing by domestic livestock prior to and immediately after treatment (Keeley, 2006), or conducting a low impact disturbance (e.g. burning only); Dodson and Fiedler, 2006; Laughlin et al. 2008). Thinning treatments in particular can be modified to reduce soil disturbance (which facilitates invasion of exotic plants). Also, thinning in winter months when equipment will drive over snow will also minimize soil disturbance and thus, the probability of invasion (Gundale et al., 2005).

We had insufficient data on forbs to generate significant results. Further studies directed at the effects of fire and fire surrogates on forb richness and cover are needed for analysis to take place.


Many of the studies included in this review concluded that multiple entries into a forest are needed to properly restore the understory to the historical range of variation (Harrington and Edwards, 1999; Metlen and Fiedler, 2006; Laughlin et al., 2008; Waldrop et al., 2008). Few studies have followed systems over multiple entries; however, Laughlin et al. (2008) followed a restoration for over a decade after multiple entries. In this system, there was an immediate positive response to herbaceous production. However, differences in species richness took much longer to occur; species richness was higher in treated areas compared to controls after 11 years. The results from this long-term study indicate that restoration of the understory to historical variability is a long-term process involving repeated prescribed burns. The Laughlin et al. (2008) data also provide another important lesson: active fire suppression has occurred for most of the last century and restoration management of the forests is a relatively new occurrence, therefore, it may take multiple treatments to restore a forest. In addition, it may take many years before the effects of the treatments are fully realized.


While it may take many years for the effects of restoration treatments to become fully realized, the results also depend on the pretreatment condition of the area (Dodson et al., 2008). Dodson et al. (2008) found that treatments did affect understory plant response but the degree of the response was dependent on the pre-treatment condition of the forest such that greater responses were observed in treatment plots with lower initial values. One reason Dodson et al. (2008) were able to document this affect was the Before-After-Control-Impact design of the FFS study. Instead of only collecting data in an unmanipulated “control” plot, pretreatment data were also collected. This is a powerful experimental design that should be encouraged in future investigations of forest restoration.

Dodson et al. (2010) investigated potential differences in treatment effect at multiple spatial scales. They found that treatment did not significantly affect species richness at the smaller quadrat scale (alpha diversity) but diversity at the unit scale (beta diversity) was significantly increased. Thus, effects of forest treatments may not be evident at the scale at which most monitoring is conducted (1m2) but overall impacts may be evident at the forest level. The studies included in this review typically measured results at smaller spatial scales (1-400m2) and evaluated alpha diversity. However, additional analysis to investigate beta diversity may reveal more consistent patterns and may shed light on large-scale impacts of fire and fire surrogate treatments on understory plant communities.

Finally human socio-economic factors are often considered when determining application of treatments. Exotic plants are also associated with the wildland urban interface (WUI) because many exotics are used in landscape and horticultural plantings. Although the Healthy Forest Restoration Act (2003) mandates that most of the forest restoration occurs at the WUI, it is important to recognize that these areas serve as foci for exotic spread into the forest matrix (Bartuszevige et al., 2006). Invasion of the forest by exotic plants works against the prescribed goals of forest management to reduce wildfire risk and increase native biodiversity. Some exotic plants can change the fire interval or intensity through a variety of mechanisms such as increasing fuel loads or moisture content of the fuel (Brooks et al., 2004). In addition, exotic plants can reduce biodiversity by becoming the dominant species in the forest understory.

Non-native plants were recorded in most studies we presented, but were often at a low density or cover, even post-treatment. Regardless, it is important to understand the potential threat of these species to native understory species in forested landscapes. In general, prescribed fire and thinning treatments can be used successfully to restore understory community composition, but managers would be wise to take into consideration the presence and potential impacts of exotic plants.
