Abella,"Excluded because only had thin+burn treatments--no thin alone, and no burn alone"
Adel et al.,Excluded due to reporting data outside of the Northern Hemisphere (data came from Northern Iran)
Amour,Excluded because SE's were not included
Ares+Neill+etal-2010,Excluded due to data collection taking place too long after treatment (11 years)
Burton+Hallgren+etal-2011,Excluded due to incorrect method of data reporting (Figure 7)
Busse+Simon+etal-2000,Excluded due to incorrect method of data reporting (Table 7)
Collins+Moghaddas+etal-2007,"Used means and SE's. I took data from Table 1 on page 105. Years since treatment was 2, from page 105 under ""Vegetation measurements"""
Dodson+Peterson-2010,Excluded due to incorrect method of data reporting (Figures 1 and 2)
Dodson+Peterson+etal-2008,Excluded due to incorrect method of data reporting (Table 2)
Dodson+Metlen+etal-2007,"Used a ruler to measure means and SE's. The timing of pre and post testing was vague: According to 'Vegetation Sampling' on page 698, Pre-tests took place in 2000 for thin-only, and 2001 for burn-only and control. Post-treatment data collection took place in 2002, 2003, and 2004 (so the timing for thin-only is different than the timing for burn-only and control). However, under 'Statistical Analysis' on the same page, it says that richness values were calculated 3 years post-treatment, in 2004. Because there was a difference between pre-testing years, if all post-tests for this took place in 2004, then there would be a difference of 1 year between the length of treatment between thin-only and the other two groups. I decided to assume that there was a 3 year treatment time. With regards to n, our previous document recorded a value of n=3. According to me, it seems that we should use n=30 based on page 699 (the paragraph before results). I chose to use n=3 until this recommendation can be checked. Data was extracted from Figure 1 on page 700."
Dodson+Fiedler-2006,Removed because the data is the same as Metlen+Fiedler-2006. Used means and SE's.
Dodson-2004,Table 7 for richness. Table 5 for percent cover. Used quadrat scale for percent cover. Used treatment scale for richness. This is because treatment scale was not reported for percent cover.
Enloe et al. 2013,Excluded because SE's were not included Figure 2)
Fornwalt+Kaufmann+etal-2010,Did use.
Freeman+Stohlgren+etal-2007,"DID NOT USE, see email from Dr. Schwilk to Josh on Jan 2, 2015"
Fule+Covington+etal-2002,"Did not use, would work in unweighted. See Tables 8 and maybe 9. Email author."
Fule+Laughlin+etal-2005,Table 4
Griffis+Crawford+etal-2001,Excluded due to incorrect method of data reporting.
Harrington+Edwards-1999,Excluded because SE's were not included (Table 2)
Harrod+Halpern-2009,Excluded because the appropriate data was not included.
Huffman+Stoddard+etal-2013,Means and SE's. Used 'Native' for 'Total'. Used Table 1 on page 482.
Huisinga+Laughlin-2005,"Excluded because N=1. Table 2. Summed annual/biennial forbs, perennial forbs, and graminoids to get herbs. Would have Used unburned in 1998 for control and burned in 2001 for treatment"
Joubert et al. 2013,
Kane+Morgan+etal-2010,"Table 3 page 214. For thin, I used 'MAST' (which means mastication only). There was no 'burn only' for this study."
Kerns+Buonopane+etal-2011,Would work in Unweighted
Kerns+Thies+etal-2006,Means and SE's. Used Exotic annuals/biennals vs Natives annuals/biennals for E and N. Used Native perennial forbs for total forbs. Used Forbs as representative of total. Figure 1
Knapp+Schwilk+etal-2006,"Only differences are included, not raw pre and post values. Might work in unweighted. Perhaps original data is available?"
Laughlin+Bakker+etal-2008,Means and SE's. Fig 1 on page 144. Pulled control from 1992 and thin from 1996.
Laughlin+Fule-2008,Wrong stats
Mason+Baker+etal-2009,"Means and SE's. Three sites were available. I used all three sites for richness and cover. I used Scatter for 'Thin', and not pile. For the Bailey site, I used the data from 2005. For the Cox site, I took the average of the data from the years 2005, 2006, and 2007. I used Figure 5 on page 872 and Table 3 on page 873."
Metlen+Fiedler-2006,Used means and SE's. I took the average of the means for years 1-3 and the average of the SE's for years 1-3 and used those means of means as a representative mean (see Excel calculator for how I calculated this). Used data from Table 2 and Table 5 on pages 361 and 363
Metlen+Fiedler+etal-2004,Excluded because SE's were not included (Table 2)
Moore+Casey-2006,Excluded because did not contain correct data (reported standing crop only)
Nelson+Halpern+etal-2008,Fig 1 and 2 on page 766. A ruler was used to determine means and SE's.
Phillips+Waldrop-2008,"Used means and SE's. Table 4, page 3112. Took average of the means from 1st year post and 3rd year post."
Phillips+Hutchinson-2007,"Figure 2. Figure 4. I averaged the ""pre"" treatments for control. Then, I used the individual values for thin and burn from the 2 years later data points."
Phillips+Waldrop+etal-2004,Would work in Unweighted
Scudieri+Sieg+etal-2010,Means and SE's. Utilized figures 2 and 3 on pages 2138 and 2139.
Shartell+Nagel+etal-2012,Excluded because thinning and burning was done on the target species (Garlic Mustard) rather than the area in general. Would work in unweighted
Shive+Kuenzi+etal-2013,Means and SE's. Unsure if the statistics reported in this paper are usable. Removed do to seeding and time post-fire
Shive+Sieg+etal-2013,Excluded because the appropriate amount of time did not take place between treatments
Stoddard+McGlone+etal-2011,Excluded because the appropriate amount of time did not take place between treatments
Waldrop+Yaussy+etal-2008,"Fig 4, 5, and 6 on pages 3123, 3124, and 3125 were used. Years 1 and 3 were averaged for means and SE's."
Waldrop+Phillips+etal-2010,Figure 2. Used Control from year 0. Used Burn and Mechanical from year 3.
Wayman+North-2007,"No SE's given. It may be best to remove this paper. The data I used was from Fig 2 on page 38. For richness, I used the data from 2003. There was no SE given, so I entered ""0.1"" as a placeholder for richness until we decide what to do about this. There was no SE given for cover as well, so I entered ""1.0"" as a placeholder. This needs to be justified, a better value determined, another way to calculate d must be used, or this paper needs to be thrown out.EDIT on 1/1/2015 This was removed because I don't think it is ok to use 0.1 as a placeholder. This paper is currently removed."
Wienk+Sieg+etal-2004,"Used means and SE's. Took data from Table 8, page 385. I utilized 'Partial cut' as opposed to 'Clearcut', which was also available."
Wolk+Rocca-2009,"Used means and SE's. Took data from Table 4. Used 'Total (# species/1000 m^2). Used 'Thin-only' as opposed to 'Thin + chip'. Variable amounts of time ""at least 3 years"""
Youngblood+Metlen+etal-2006,"Used means and SE's. Took data from Table 9, page 156. Additional data is potentially available from Table 8, page 156, but I was unsure of how to extract this data."
Zald+Gray+etal-2008,"Means and SE's. Table 2. Did not use data for shrubs because the first data point in Table 2 is an average of 11 years. I used the data from Figure 5 on page 872, "
Zenner+Kabrick+etal-2006,"Fig 1 page 327, Fig 2. Only the difference between pre and post is given; the actualy pre and most means are not included. I attempted to calculate d the way I did for regular data. I am not sure if this is accurate. See Excel Calculation File."
Zhang+Webster+etal-2008,"Fig 5 page 915. Only has data for immediately after treatments and 5 years later. I am using the 5 years later data. There is only data for shrubs, but I am going to include this paper in the total.richness file. In doing so I am assuming that shrubs serve as an indicator species for other understory species."
Provencher+Thompson-2014,Used. Went with LS. 
Fornwalt+Kaufmann+etal-2014,Went with Moderate Severity for Fig 3 etc. for Upland. Went with Low Short for Riparian.
