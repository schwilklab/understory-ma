,Dodson et al. 2007,"Erich K. Dodson, Kerry L. Metlen, and Carl E. Fiedler","Used a ruler to measure means and SE's. The timing of pre and post testing was vague: According to 'Vegetation Sampling' on page 698, Pre-tests took place in 2000 for thin-only, and 2001 for burn-only and control. Post-treatment data collection took place in 2002, 2003, and 2004 (so the timing for thin-only is different than the timing for burn-only and control). However, under 'Statistical Analysis' on the same page, it says that richness values were calculated 3 years post-treatment, in 2004. Because there was a difference between pre-testing years, if all post-tests for this took place in 2004, then there would be a difference of 1 year between the length of treatment between thin-only and the other two groups. I decided to assume that there was a 3 year treatment time. With regards to n, our previous document recorded a value of n=3. According to me, it seems that we should use n=30 based on page 699 (the paragraph before results). I chose to use n=3 until this recommendation can be checked. Data was extracted from Figure 1 on page 700.",,,,,
