Forest plots of effect sizes are produced by the R code (https://github.com/schwilklab/understory-ma/blob/master/scripts/understory-stats.R).  Those plots are saved in [.results/plots] which is not under version control

A spreadsheet of the confidence intervals is here: [../results/confidence-intervals.csv] on github:  https://github.com/schwilklab/understory-ma/blob/master/results/confidence-intervals.csv

And there is also a results summary: [./results/results-outline.md](https://github.com/schwilklab/understory-ma/blob/master/results/results-outline.md)
